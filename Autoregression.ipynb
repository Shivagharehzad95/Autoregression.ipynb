            "tf.Tensor(b'ex oblivione\\n\\nwhen the last days were upon me , and the ugly trifles of existence began to drive me to madness like the small drops of water that torturers let fall ceaselessly upon one spot of their victims body , i loved the irradiate refuge of sleep . in my dreams i found a little of the beauty i had vainly sought in life , and wandered through old gardens and enchanted woods .\\n\\nonce when the wind was soft and scented i heard the south calling , and sailed endlessly and languorously under strange stars .\\n\\nonce when the gentle rain fell i glided in a barge down a sunless stream under the earth till i reached another world of purple twilight , iridescent arbours , and undying roses .\\n\\nand once i walked through a golden valley that led to shadowy groves and ruins , and ended in a mighty wall green with antique vines , and pierced by a little gate of bronze .\\n\\nmany times i walked through that valley , and longer and longer would i pause in the spectral half-light where the giant trees squirmed and twisted grotesquely , and the grey ground stretched damply from trunk to trunk , sometimes disclosing the mould-stained stones of buried temples . and always the goal of my fancies was the mighty vine-grown wall with the little gate of bronze therein .\\n\\nafter awhile , as the days of waking became less and less bearable from their greyness and sameness , i would often drift in opiate peace through the valley and the shadowy groves , and wonder how i might seize them for my eternal dwelling-place , so that i need no more crawl back to a dull world stript of interest and new colours . and as i looked upon the little gate in the mighty wall , i felt that beyond it lay a dream-country from which , once it was entered , there would be no return .\\n\\nso each night in sleep i strove to find the hidden latch of the gate in the ivied antique wall , though it was exceedingly well hidden . and i would tell myself that the realm beyond the wall was not more lasting merely , but more lovely and radiant as well .\\n\\nthen one night in the dream-city of zakarion i found a yellowed papyrus filled with the thoughts of dream-sages who dwelt of old in that city , and who were too wise ever to be born in the waking world . therein were written many things concerning the world of dream , and among them was lore of a golden valley and a sacred grove with temples , and a high wall pierced by a little bronze gate . when i saw this lore , i knew that it touched on the scenes i had haunted , and i therefore read long in the yellowed papyrus .\\n\\nsome of the dream-sages wrote gorgeously of the wonders beyond the irrepassable gate , but others told of horror and disappointment . i knew not which to believe , yet longed more and more to cross forever into the unknown land ; for doubt and secrecy are the lure of lures , and no new horror can be more terrible than the daily torture of the commonplace . so when i learned of the drug which would unlock the gate and drive me through , i resolved to take it when next i awaked .\\n\\nlast night i swallowed the drug and floated dreamily into the golden valley and the shadowy groves ; and when i came this time to the antique wall , i saw that the small gate of bronze was ajar . from beyond came a glow that weirdly lit the giant twisted trees and the tops of the buried temples , and i drifted on songfully , expectant of the glories of the land from whence i should never return .\\n\\nbut as the gate swung wider and the sorcery of the drug and the dream pushed me through , i knew that all sights and glories were at an end ; for in that new realm was neither land nor sea , but only the white void of unpeopled and illimitable space . so , happier than i had ever dared hope to be , i dissolved again into that native infinity of crystal oblivion from which the daemon life had called me for one brief and desolate hour .\\n', shape=(), dtype=string)\n",
            "tf.Tensor(b'the hound\\n\\nin my tortured ears there sounds unceasingly a nightmare whirring and flapping , and a faint distant baying as of some gigantic hound . it is not dream--it is not , i fear , even madness--for too much has already happened to give me these merciful doubts .\\n\\nst john is a mangled corpse ; i alone know why , and such is my knowledge that i am about to blow out my brains for fear i shall be mangled in the same way . down unlit and illimitable corridors of eldrith phantasy sweeps the black , shapeless nemesis that drives me to self-annihilation .\\n\\nmay heaven forgive the folly and morbidity which led us both to so monstrous a fate ! wearied with the commonplaces of a prosaic world ; where even the joys of romance and adventure soon grow stale , st john and i had followed enthusiastically every aesthetic and intellectual movement which promised respite from our devastating ennui . the enigmas of the symbolists and the ecstasies of the pre-raphaelites all were ours in their time , but each new mood was drained too soon , of its diverting novelty and appeal .\\n\\nonly the somber philosophy of the decadents could help us , and this we found potent only by increasing gradually the depth and diablism of our penetrations . baudelaire and huysmans were soon exhausted of thrills , till finally there remained for us only the more direct stimuli of unnatural personal experiences and adventures . it was this frightful emotional need which led us eventually to that detestable course which even in my present fear i mention with shame and timidity--that hideous extremity of human outrage , the abhorred practice of grave-robbing .\\n\\ni cannot reveal the details of our shocking expedition , or catalogue even partly the worst of the trophies adorning the nameless museum where we jointly dwelt , alone and servantless . our museum was a blasphemous , unthinkable place , where with the satanic taste of neurotic virtuosi we had assembled an universe of terror and a secret room , far , far , underground ; where huge winged daemons carven of basalt and onyx vomited from wide grinning mouths weird green and orange light , and hidden pneumatic pipes ruffled into kaleidoscopic dances of death the line of red charnel things hand in hand woven in voluminous black hangings . through these pipes came at will the odors our moods most craved ; sometimes the scent of pale funeral lilies ; sometimes the narcotic incense of imagined eastern shrines of the kingly dead , and sometimes--how i shudder to recall it !--the frightful , soul-upheaving stenches of the uncovered-grave .\\n\\naround the walls of this repellent chamber were cases of antique mummies alternating with comely , lifelike bodies perfectly stuffed and cured by the taxidermist\\'s art , and with headstones snatched from the oldest churchyards of the world . niches here and there contained skulls of all shapes , and heads preserved in various stages of dissolution . there one might find the rotting , bald pates of famous noblemen , and the flesh and radiantly golden heads of new-buried children .\\n\\nstatues and painting there were , all of fiendish subjects and some executed by st john and myself . a locked portfolio , bound in tanned human skin , held certain unknown and unnameable drawings which it was rumored goya had perpetrated but dared not acknowledge . there were nauseous musical instruments , stringed , brass , wood-wind , on which st john and i sometimes produced dissonances of exquisite morbidity and cacodaemoniacal ghastliness ; whilst in a multitude of inlaid ebony cabinets reposed the most incredible and unimaginable variety of tomb-loot ever assembled by human madness and perversity . it is of this loot in particular that i destroy it long before i thought of destroying myself !\\n\\nthe predatory excursions on which we collected our unmentionable treasures were always artistically memorable events . we were no vulgar ghouls , but worked only under certain conditions of mood , landscape , environment , weather , season , and moonlight . these pastimes were to us the most exquisite form of aesthetic expression , and we gave their details a fastidious technical care . an inappropriate hour , a jarring lighting effect , or a clumsy manipulation of the damp sod , would almost totally destroy for us that ecstatic titillation which followed the exhumation of some ominous , grinning secret of the earth . our quest for novel scenes and piquant conditions was feverish and insatiate--st john was always the leader , and he it was who led the way at last to that mocking , accursed spot which brought us our hideous and inevitable doom .\\n\\nby what malign fatality were we lured to that terrible holland churchyard ? i think it was the dark rumor and legendry , the tales of one buried for five centuries , who had himself been a ghoul in his time and had stolen a potent thing from a mighty sepulchre . i can recall the scene in these final moments--the pale autumnal moon over the graves , casting long horrible shadows ; the grotesque trees , drooping sullenly to meet the neglected grass and the crumbling slabs ; the vast legions of strangely colossal bats that flew against the moon ; the antique ivied church pointing a huge spectral finger at the livid sky ; the phosphorescent insects that danced like death-fires under the yews in a distant corner ; the odors of mould , vegetation , and less explicable things that mingled feebly with the night-wind from over far swamps and seas ; and , worst of all , the faint deep-toned baying of some gigantic hound which we could neither see nor definitely place . as we heard this suggestion of baying we shuddered , remembering the tales of the peasantry ; for he whom we sought had centuries before been found in this self same spot , torn and mangled by the claws and teeth of some unspeakable beast .\\n\\ni remember how we delved in the ghoul\\'s grave with our spades , and how we thrilled at the picture of ourselves , the grave , the pale watching moon , the horrible shadows , the grotesque trees , the titanic bats , the antique church , the dancing death-fires , the sickening odors , the gently moaning night-wind , and the strange , half-heard directionless baying of whose objective existence we could scarcely be sure .\\n\\nthen we struck a substance harder than the damp mould , and beheld a rotting oblong box crusted with mineral deposits from the long undisturbed ground . it was incredibly tough and thick , but so old that we finally pried it open and feasted our eyes on what it held .\\n\\nmuch--amazingly much--was left of the object despite the lapse of five hundred years . the skeleton , though crushed in places by the jaws of the thing that had killed it , held together with surprising firmness , and we gloated over the clean white skull and its long , firm teeth and its eyeless sockets that once had glowed with a charnel fever like our own . in the coffin lay an amulet of curious and exotic design , which had apparently been worn around the sleeper\\'s neck . it was the oddly conventionalised figure of a crouching winged hound , or sphinx with a semi-canine face , and was exquisitely carved in antique oriental fashion from a small piece of green jade . the expression of its features was repellent in the extreme , savoring at once of death , bestiality and malevolence . around the base was an inscription in characters which neither st john nor i could identify ; and on the bottom , like a maker\\'s seal , was graven a grotesque and formidable skull .\\n\\nimmediately upon beholding this amulet we knew that we must possess it ; that this treasure alone was our logical pelf from the centuried grave . even had its outlines been unfamiliar we would have desired it , but as we looked more closely we saw that it was not wholly unfamiliar . alien it indeed was to all art and literature which sane and balanced readers know , but we recognized it as the thing hinted of in the forbidden necronomicon of the mad arab abdul alhazred ; the ghastly soul-symbol of the corpse-eating cult of inaccessible leng , in central asia . all too well did we trace the sinister lineaments described by the old arab daemonologist ; lineaments , he wrote , drawn from some obscure supernatural manifestation of the souls of those who vexed and gnawed at the dead .\\n\\nseizing the green jade object , we gave a last glance at the bleached and cavern-eyed face of its owner and closed up the grave as we found it . as we hastened from the abhorrent spot , the stolen amulet in st john\\'s pocket , we thought we saw the bats descend in a body to the earth we had so lately rifled , as if seeking for some cursed and unholy nourishment . but the autumn moon shone weak and pale , and we could not be sure .\\n\\nso , too , as we sailed the next day away from holland to our home , we thought we heard the faint distant baying of some gigantic hound in the background . but the autumn wind moaned sad and wan , and we could not be sure .\\n\\nless than a week after our return to england , strange things began to happen . we lived as recluses ; devoid of friends , alone , and without servants in a few rooms of an ancient manor-house on a bleak and unfrequented moor ; so that our doors were seldom disturbed by the knock of the visitor .\\n\\nnow , however , we were troubled by what seemed to be a frequent fumbling in the night , not only around the doors but around the windows also , upper as well as lower . once we fancied that a large , opaque body darkened the library window when the moon was shining against it , and another time we thought we heard a whirring or flapping sound not far off . on each occasion investigation revealed nothing , and we began to ascribe the occurrences to imagination which still prolonged in our ears the faint far baying we thought we had heard in the holland churchyard . the jade amulet now reposed in a niche in our museum , and sometimes we burned a strangely scented candle before it . we read much in alhazred\\'s necronomicon about its properties , and about the relation of ghosts\\' souls to the objects it symbolized ; and were disturbed by what we read .\\n\\nthen terror came .\\n\\non the night of september 24 , 19-- , i heard a knock at my chamber door . fancying it st john\\'s , i bade the knocker enter , but was answered only by a shrill laugh . there was no one in the corridor . when i aroused st john from his sleep , he professed entire ignorance of the event , and became as worried as i . it was the night that the faint , distant baying over the moor became to us a certain and dreaded reality .\\n\\nfour days later , whilst we were both in the hidden museum , there came a low , cautious scratching at the single door which led to the secret library staircase . our alarm was now divided , for , besides our fear of the unknown , we had always entertained a dread that our grisly collection might be discovered . extinguishing all lights , we proceeded to the door and threw it suddenly open ; whereupon we felt an unaccountable rush of air , and heard , as if receding far away , a queer combination of rustling , tittering , and articulate chatter . whether we were mad , dreaming , or in our senses , we did not try to determine . we only realized , with the blackest of apprehensions , that the apparently disembodied chatter was beyond a doubt in the dutch language .\\n\\nafter that we lived in growing horror and fascination . mostly we held to the theory that we were jointly going mad from our life of unnatural excitements , but sometimes it pleased us more to dramatize ourselves as the victims of some creeping and appalling doom . bizarre manifestations were now too frequent to count . our lonely house was seemingly alive with the presence of some malign being whose nature we could not guess , and every night that daemoniac baying rolled over the wind-swept moor , always louder and louder . on october 29 we found in the soft earth underneath the library window a series of footprints utterly impossible to describe . they were as baffling as the hordes of great bats which haunted the old manor-house in unprecedented and increasing numbers .\\n\\nthe horror reached a culmination on november 18 , when st john , walking home after dark from the dismal railway station , was seized by some frightful carnivorous thing and torn to ribbons . his screams had reached the house , and i had hastened to the terrible scene in time to hear a whir of wings and see a vague black cloudy thing silhouetted against the rising moon .\\n\\nmy friend was dying when i spoke to him , and he could not answer coherently . all he could do was to whisper , \"the amulet--that damned thing--\"\\n\\nthen he collapsed , an inert mass of mangled flesh .\\n\\ni buried him the next midnight in one of our neglected gardens , and mumbled over his body one of the devilish rituals he had loved in life . and as i pronounced the last daemoniac sentence i heard afar on the moor the faint baying of some gigantic hound . the moon was up , but i dared not look at it . and when i saw on the dim-lighted moor a wide , nebulous shadow sweeping from mound to mound , i shut my eyes and threw myself face down upon the ground . when i arose , trembling , i know not how much later , i staggered into the house and made shocking obeisances before the enshrined amulet of green jade .\\n\\nbeing now afraid to live alone in the ancient house on the moor , i departed on the following day for london , taking with me the amulet after destroying by fire and burial the rest of the impious collection in the museum . but after three nights i heard the baying again , and before a week was over felt strange eyes upon me whenever it was dark . one evening as i strolled on victoria embankment for some needed air , i saw a black shape obscure one of the reflections of the lamps in the water . a wind , stronger than the night-wind , rushed by , and i knew that what had befallen st john must soon befall me .\\n\\nthe next day i carefully wrapped the green jade amulet and sailed for holland . what mercy i might gain by returning the thing to its silent , sleeping owner i knew not ; but i felt that i must try any step conceivably logical . what the hound was , and why it had pursued me , were questions still vague ; but i had first heard the baying in that ancient churchyard , and every subsequent event including st john\\'s dying whisper had served to connect the curse with the stealing of the amulet . accordingly i sank into the nethermost abysses of despair when , at an inn in rotterdam , i discovered that thieves had despoiled me of this sole means of salvation .\\n\\nthe baying was loud that evening , and in the morning i read of a nameless deed in the vilest quarter of the city . the rabble were in terror , for upon an evil tenement had fallen a red death beyond the foulest previous crime of the neighborhood . in a squalid thieves\\' den an entire family had been torn to shreds by an unknown thing which left no trace , and those around had heard all night a faint , deep , insistent note as of a gigantic hound .\\n\\nso at last i stood again in the unwholesome churchyard where a pale winter moon cast hideous shadows and leafless trees drooped sullenly to meet the withered , frosty grass and cracking slabs , and the ivied church pointed a jeering finger at the unfriendly sky , and the night--wind howled maniacally from over frozen swamps and frigid seas . the baying was very faint now , and it ceased altogether as i approached the ancient grave i had once violated , and frightened away an abnormally large horde of bats which had been hovering curiously around it .\\n\\ni know not why i went thither unless to pray , or gibber out insane pleas and apologies to the calm white thing that lay within ; but , whatever my reason , i attacked the half frozen sod with a desperation partly mine and partly that of a dominating will outside myself . excavation was much easier than i expected , though at one point i encountered a queer interruption ; when a lean vulture darted down out of the cold sky and pecked frantically at the grave-earth until i killed him with a blow of my spade . finally i reached the rotting oblong box and removed the damp nitrous cover . this is the last rational act i ever performed .\\n\\nfor crouched within that centuried coffin , embraced by a closepacked nightmare retinue of huge , sinewy , sleeping bats , was the bony thing my friend and i had robbed ; not clean and placid as we had seen it then , but covered with caked blood and shreds of alien flesh and hair , and leering sentiently at me with phosphorescent sockets and sharp ensanguined fangs yawning twistedly in mockery of my inevitable doom . and when it gave from those grinning jaws a deep , sardonic bay as of some gigantic hound , and i saw that it held in its gory filthy claw the lost and fateful amulet of green jade , i merely screamed and ran away idiotically , my screams soon dissolving into peals of hysterical laughter .\\n\\nmadness rides the star-wind . . .claws and teeth sharpened on centuries of corpses . . .dripping death astride a bacchanale of bats from nigh--black ruins of buried temples of belial . . .now , as the baying of that dead fleshless monstrosity grows louder and louder , and the stealthy whirring and flapping of those accursed web-wings closer and closer , i shall seek with my revolver the oblivion which is my only refuge from the unnamed and unnameable .\\n', shape=(), dtype=string)\n",
            "tf.Tensor(b\"the doom that came to sarnath\\n\\nwritten on december 3 , 1919 . published june 1920 in the scot\\n\\nthere is in the land of mnar a vast still lake that is fed by no stream , and out of which no stream flows . ten thousand years ago there stood by its shore the mighty city of sarnath , but sarnath stands there no more .\\n\\nit is told that in the immemorial years when the world was young , before ever the men of sarnath came to the land of mnar , another city stood beside the lake ; the gray stone city of ib , which was old as the lake itself , and peopled with beings not pleasing to behold . very odd and ugly were these beings , as indeed are most beings of a world yet inchoate and rudely fashioned . it is written on the brick cylinders of kadatheron that the beings of ib were in hue as green as the lake and the mists that rise above it ; that they had bulging eyes , pouting , flabby lips , and curious ears , and were without voice . it is also written that they descended one night from the moon in a mist ; they and the vast still lake and gray stone city ib . however this may be , it is certain that they worshipped a sea-green stone idol chiseled in the likeness of bokrug , the great water-lizard ; before which they danced horribly when the moon was gibbous . and it is written in the papyrus of ilarnek , that they one day discovered fire , and thereafter kindled flames on many ceremonial occasions . but not much is written of these beings , because they lived in very ancient times , and man is young , and knows but little of the very ancient living things .\\n\\nafter many eons men came to the land of mnar , dark shepherd folk with their fleecy flocks , who built thraa , ilarnek , and kadatheron on the winding river ai . and certain tribes , more hardy than the rest , pushed on to the border of the lake and built sarnath at a spot where precious metals were found in the earth .\\n\\nnot far from the gray city of ib did the wandering tribes lay the first stones of sarnath , and at the beings of ib they marveled greatly . but with their marveling was mixed hate , for they thought it not meet that beings of such aspect should walk about the world of men at dusk . nor did they like the strange sculptures upon the gray monoliths of ib , for why those sculptures lingered so late in the world , even until the coming men , none can tell ; unless it was because the land of mnar is very still , and remote from most other lands , both of waking and of dream .\\n\\nas the men of sarnath beheld more of the beings of ib their hate grew , and it was not less because they found the beings weak , and soft as jelly to the touch of stones and arrows . so one day the young warriors , the slingers and the spearmen and the bowmen , marched against ib and slew all the inhabitants thereof , pushing the queer bodies into the lake with long spears , because they did not wish to touch them . and because they did not like the gray sculptured monoliths of ib they cast these also into the lake ; wondering from the greatness of the labor how ever the stones were brought from afar , as they must have been , since there is naught like them in the land of mnar or in the lands adjacent .\\n\\nthus of the very ancient city of ib was nothing spared , save the sea--green stone idol chiseled in the likeness of bokrug , the water-lizard . this the young warriors took back with them as a symbol of conquest over the old gods and beings of th , and as a sign of leadership in mnar . but on the night after it was set up in the temple , a terrible thing must have happened , for weird lights were seen over the lake , and in the morning the people found the idol gone and the high-priest taran-ish lying dead , as from some fear unspeakable . and before he died , taran-ish had scrawled upon the altar of chrysolite with coarse shaky strokes the sign of doom .\\n\\nafter taran-ish there were many high-priests in sarnath but never was the sea-green stone idol found . and many centuries came and went , wherein sarnath prospered exceedingly , so that only priests and old women remembered what taran-ish had scrawled upon the altar of chrysolite . betwixt sarnath and the city of ilarnek arose a caravan route , and the precious metals from the earth were exchanged for other metals and rare cloths and jewels and books and tools for artificers and all things of luxury that are known to the people who dwell along the winding river ai and beyond . so sarnath waxed mighty and learned and beautiful , and sent forth conquering armies to subdue the neighboring cities ; and in time there sate upon a throne in sarnath the kings of all the land of mnar and of many lands adjacent .\\n\\nthe wonder of the world and the pride of all mankind was sarnath the magnificent . of polished desert-quarried marble were its walls , in height three hundred cubits and in breadth seventy-five , so that chariots might pass each other as men drove them along the top . for full five hundred stadia did they run , being open only on the side toward the lake where a green stone sea-wall kept back the waves that rose oddly once a year at the festival of the destroying of ib . in sarnath were fifty streets from the lake to the gates of the caravans , and fifty more intersecting them . with onyx were they paved , save those whereon the horses and camels and elephants trod , which were paved with granite . and the gates of sarnath were as many as the landward ends of the streets , each of bronze , and flanked by the figures of lions and elephants carven from some stone no longer known among men . the houses of sarnath were of glazed brick and chalcedony , each having its walled garden and crystal lakelet . with strange art were they builded , for no other city had houses like them ; and travelers from thraa and ilarnek and kadatheron marveled at the shining domes wherewith they were surmounted .\\n\\nbut more marvelous still were the palaces and the temples , and the gardens made by zokkar the olden king . there were many palaces , the last of which were mightier than any in thraa or ilarnek or kadatheron . so high were they that one within might sometimes fancy himself beneath only the sky ; yet when lighted with torches dipt in the oil of dother their walls showed vast paintings of kings and armies , of a splendor at once inspiring and stupefying to the beholder . many were the pillars of the palaces , all of tinted marble , and carven into designs of surpassing beauty . and in most of the palaces the floors were mosaics of beryl and lapis lazuli and sardonyx and carbuncle and other choice materials , so disposed that the beholder might fancy himself walking over beds of the rarest flowers . and there were likewise fountains , which cast scented waters about in pleasing jets arranged with cunning art . outshining all others was the palace of the kings of mnar and of the lands adjacent . on a pair of golden crouching lions rested the throne , many steps above the gleaming floor . and it was wrought of one piece of ivory , though no man lives who knows whence so vast a piece could have come . in that palace there were also many galleries , and many amphitheaters where lions and men and elephants battled at the pleasure of the kings . sometimes the amphitheaters were flooded with water conveyed from the lake in mighty aqueducts , and then were enacted stirring sea-fights , or combats betwixt swimmers and deadly marine things .\\n\\nlofty and amazing were the seventeen tower-like temples of sarnath , fashioned of a bright multi-colored stone not known elsewhere . a full thousand cubits high stood the greatest among them , wherein the high--priests dwelt with a magnificence scarce less than that of the kings . on the ground were halls as vast and splendid as those of the palaces ; where gathered throngs in worship of zo-kalar and tamash and lobon , the chief gods of sarnath , whose incense-enveloped shrines were as the thrones of monarchs . not like the eikons of other gods were those of zo-kalar and tamash and lobon . for so close to life were they that one might swear the graceful bearded gods themselves sate on the ivory thrones . and up unending steps of zircon was the tower-chamber , wherefrom the high-priests looked out over the city and the plains and the lake by day ; and at the cryptic moon and significant stars and planets , and their reflections in the lake , at night . here was done the very secret and ancient rite in detestation of bokrug , the water--lizard , and here rested the altar of chrysolite which bore the doom--scrawl of taran-ish .\\n\\nwonderful likewise were the gardens made by zokkar the olden king . in the center of sarnath they lay , covering a great space and encircled by a high wall . and they were surmounted by a mighty dome of glass , through which shone the sun and moon and planets when it was clear , and from which were hung fulgent images of the sun and moon and stars and planets when it was not clear . in summer the gardens were cooled with fresh odorous breezes skilfully wafted by fans , and in winter they were heated with concealed fires , so that in those gardens it was always spring . there ran little streams over bright pebbles , dividing meads of green and gardens of many hues , and spanned by a multitude of bridges . many were the waterfalls in their courses , and many were the hued lakelets into which they expanded . over the streams and lakelets rode white swans , whilst the music of rare birds chimed in with the melody of the waters . in ordered terraces rose the green banks , adorned here and there with bowers of vines and sweet blossoms , and seats and benches of marble and porphyry . and there were many small shrines and temples where one might rest or pray to small gods .\\n\\neach year there was celebrated in sarnath the feast of the destroying of ib , at which time wine , song , dancing , and merriment of every kind abounded . great honors were then paid to the shades of those who had annihilated the odd ancient beings , and the memory of those beings and of their elder gods was derided by dancers and lutanists crowned with roses from the gardens of zokkar . and the kings would look out over the lake and curse the bones of the dead that lay beneath it .\\n\\nat first the high-priests liked not these festivals , for there had descended amongst them queer tales of how the sea-green eikon had vanished , and how taran-ish had died from fear and left a warning . and they said that from their high tower they sometimes saw lights beneath the waters of the lake . but as many years passed without calamity even the priests laughed and cursed and joined in the orgies of the feasters . indeed , had they not themselves , in their high tower , often performed the very ancient and secret rite in detestation of bokrug , the water-lizard ? and a thousand years of riches and delight passed over sarnath , wonder of the world .\\n\\ngorgeous beyond thought was the feast of the thousandth year of the destroying of ib . for a decade had it been talked of in the land of mnar , and as it drew nigh there came to sarnath on horses and camels and elephants men from thraa , ilarnek , and kadetheron , and all the cities of mnar and the lands beyond . before the marble walls on the appointed night were pitched the pavilions of princes and the tents of travelers . within his banquet-hall reclined nargis-hei , the king , drunken with ancient wine from the vaults of conquered pnoth , and surrounded by feasting nobles and hurrying slaves . there were eaten many strange delicacies at that feast ; peacocks from the distant hills of linplan , heels of camels from the bnazic desert , nuts and spices from sydathrian groves , and pearls from wave-washed mtal dissolved in the vinegar of thraa . of sauces there were an untold number , prepared by the subtlest cooks in all mnar , and suited to the palate of every feaster . but most prized of all the viands were the great fishes from the lake , each of vast size , and served upon golden platters set with rubies and diamonds .\\n\\nwhilst the king and his nobles feasted within the palace , and viewed the crowning dish as it awaited them on golden platters , others feasted elsewhere . in the tower of the great temple the priests held revels , and in pavilions without the walls the princes of neighboring lands made merry . and it was the high-priest gnai-kah who first saw the shadows that descended from the gibbous moon into the lake , and the damnable green mists that arose from the lake to meet the moon and to shroud in a sinister haze the towers and the domes of fated sarnath . thereafter those in the towers and without the walls beheld strange lights on the water , and saw that the gray rock akurion , which was wont to rear high above it near the shore , was almost submerged . and fear grew vaguely yet swiftly , so that the princes of ilarnek and of far rokol took down and folded their tents and pavilions and departed , though they scarce knew the reason for their departing .\\n\\nthen , close to the hour of midnight , all the bronze gates of sarnath burst open and emptied forth a frenzied throng that blackened the plain , so that all the visiting princes and travelers fled away in fright . for on the faces of this throng was writ a madness born of horror unendurable , and on their tongues were words so terrible that no hearer paused for proof . men whose eyes were wild with fear shrieked aloud of the sight within the king's banquet-hall , where through the windows were seen no longer the forms of nargis-hei and his nobles and slaves , but a horde of indescribable green voiceless things with bulging eyes , pouting , flabby lips , and curious ears ; things which danced horribly , bearing in their paws golden platters set with rubies and diamonds and containing uncouth flames . and the princes and travelers , as they fled from the doomed city of sarnath on horses and camels and elephants , looked again upon the mist-begetting lake and saw the gray rock akurion was quite submerged . through all the land of mnar and the land adjacent spread the tales of those who had fled from sarnath , and caravans sought that accursed city and its precious metals no more . it was long ere any travelers went thither , and even then only the brave and adventurous young men of yellow hair and blue eyes , who are no kin to the men of mnar . these men indeed went to the lake to view sarnath ; but though they found the vast still lake itself , and the gray rock akurion which rears high above it near the shore , they beheld not the wonder of the world and pride of all mankind . where once had risen walls of three hundred cubits and towers yet higher , now stretched only the marshy shore , and where once had dwelt fifty million of men now crawled the detestable water-lizard . not even the mines of precious metal remained . doom had come to sarnath .\\n\\nbut half buried in the rushes was spied a curious green idol ; an exceedingly ancient idol chiseled in the likeness of bokrug , the great water-lizard . that idol , enshrined in the high temple at ilarnek , was subsequently worshipped beneath the gibbous moon throughout the land of mnar .\\n\", shape=(), dtype=string)\n",
            "tf.Tensor(b'medusa\\'s coil\\n\\nit was a lonely and deserted country , but at last i spied a roof among a clump of trees near the small river on my right ; perhaps a full half-mile from the road , and probably reachable by some path or drive which i would presently come upon . in the absence of any nearer dwelling , i resolved to try my luck there ; and was glad when the bushes by the roadside revealed the ruin of a carved stone gateway , covered with dry , dead vines and choked with undergrowth which explained why i had not been able to trace the path across the fields in my first distant view . i saw that i could not drive the car in , so i parked it very carefully near the gate--where a thick evergreen would shield it in case of rain--and got out for the long walk to the house .\\n\\ntraversing that brush-grown path in the gathering twilight i was conscious of a distinct sense of foreboding , probably induced by the air of sinister decay hovering about the gate and the former driveway . from the carvings on the old stone pillars i inferred that this place was once an estate of manorial dignity ; and i could clearly see that the driveway had originally boasted guardian lines of linden trees , some of which had died , while others had lost their special identity among the wild scrub growths of the region .\\n\\nas i ploughed onward , cockleburs and stickers clung to my clothes , and i began to wonder whether the place could be inhabited after all . was i tramping on a vain errand ? for a moment i was tempted to go back and try some farm farther along the road , when a view of the house ahead aroused my curiosity and stimulated my venturesome spirit .\\n\\nthere was something provocatively fascinating in the tree-girt , decrepit pile before me , for it spoke of the graces and spaciousness of a bygone era and a far more southerly environment . it was a typical wooden plantation house of the classic , early nineteenth-century pattern , with two and a half stories and a great ionic portico whose pillars reached up as far as the attic and supported a triangular pediment . its state of decay was extreme and obvious ; one of the vast columns having rotted and fallen to the ground , while the upper piazza or balcony had sagged dangerously low . other buildings , i judged , had formerly stood near it .\\n\\nas i mounted the broad stone steps to the low porch and the carved and fanlighted doorway i felt distinctly nervous , and started to light a cigarette--desisting when i saw how dry and inflammable everything about me was . though now convinced that the house was deserted , i nevertheless hesitated to violate its dignity without knocking ; so tugged at the rusty iron knocker until i could get it to move , and finally set up a cautious rapping which seemed to make the whole place shake and rattle . there was no response , yet once more i plied the cumbrous , creaking device--as much to dispel the sense of unholy silence and solitude as to arouse any possible occupant of the ruin .\\n\\nsomewhere near the river i heard the mournful note of a dove , and it seemed as if the coursing water itself were faintly audible . half in a dream , i seized and rattled the ancient latch , and finally gave the great six-panelled door a frank trying . it was unlocked , as i could see in a moment ; and though it stuck and grated on its hinges i began to push it open , stepping through it into a vast shadowy hall as i did so .\\n\\nbut the moment i took this step i regretted it . it was not that a legion of specters confronted me in that dim and dusty hall with the ghostly empire furniture ; but that i knew all at once that the place was not deserted at all . there was a creaking on the great curved staircase , and the sound of faltering footsteps slowly descending . then i saw a tall , bent figure silhouetted for an instant against the great palladian window on the landing .\\n\\nmy first start of terror was soon over , and as the figure descended the final flight i was ready to greet the householder whose privacy i had invaded . in the semi-darkness i could see him reach in his pocket for a match . there came a flare as he lighted a small kerosene lamp which stood on a rickety console table near the foot of the stairs . in the feeble glow was revealed the stooping figure of a very tall , emaciated old man ; disordered as to dress and unshaved as to face , yet for all that with the bearing and expression of a gentleman .\\n\\ni did not wait for him to speak , but at once began to explain my presence .\\n\\n\"you\\'ll pardon my coming in like this , but when my knocking didn\\'t raise anybody i concluded that no one lived here . what i wanted originally was to know the right road to cape girardeau--the shortest road , that is . i wanted to get there before dark , but now , of course--\"\\n\\nas i paused , the man spoke ; in exactly the cultivated tone i had expected , and with a mellow accent as unmistakably southern as the house he inhabited .\\n\\n\"rather , you must pardon me for not answering your knock more promptly . i live in a very retired way , and am not usually expecting visitors . at first i thought you were a mere curiosity-seeker . then when you knocked again i started to answer , but i am not well and have to move very slowly . spinal neuritis--very troublesome case .\\n\\n\"but as for your getting to town before dark--it\\'s plain you can\\'t do that . the road you are on--for i suppose you came from the gate--isn\\'t the best or shortest way . what you must do is to take your first left after you leave the gate--that is , the first real road to your left . there are three or four cart paths you can ignore , but you can\\'t mistake the real road because of the extra large willow tree on the right just opposite it . then when you\\'ve turned , keep on past two roads and turn to the right along the third . after that--\"\\n\\n\"please wait a moment ! how can i follow all these clues in pitch darkness , without ever having been near here before , and with only an indifferent pair of headlights to tell me what is and what isn\\'t a road ? besides , i think it\\'s going to storm pretty soon , and my car is an open one . it looks as if i were in a bad fix if i want to get to cape girardeau tonight . the fact is , i don\\'t think i\\'d better try to make it . i don\\'t like to impose burdens , or anything like that--but in view of the circumstances , do you suppose you could put me up for the night ? i won\\'t be any trouble--no meals or anything . just let me have a corner to sleep in till daylight , and i\\'m all right . i can leave the car in the road where it is--a bit of wet weather won\\'t hurt it if worst comes to worst .\"\\n\\nas i made my sudden request i could see the old man\\'s face lose its former expression of quiet resignation and take on an odd , surprised look .\\n\\n\"sleep--here ?\"\\n\\nhe seemed so astonished at my request that i repeated it .\\n\\n\"yes , why not ? i assure you i won\\'t be any trouble . what else can i do ? i\\'m a stranger hereabouts , these roads are a labyrinth in the dark , and i\\'ll wager it\\'ll be raining torrents outside of an hour--\"\\n\\nthis time it my host\\'s turn to interrupt , and as he did so i could feel a peculiar quality in his deep , musical voice .\\n\\n\"a stranger--of course you must be , else you wouldn\\'t think of sleeping here , wouldn\\'t think of coming here at all . people don\\'t come here nowadays .\"\\n\\nhe paused , and my desire to stay was increased a thousandfold by the sense of mystery his laconic words seemed to evoke . there was surely something alluringly queer about this place , and the pervasive musty smell seemed to cloak a thousand secrets . again i noticed the extreme decrepitude of everything about me ; manifest even in the feeble rays of the single small lamp . i felt woefully chilly , and saw with regret that no heating was provided , and yet so great was my curiosity that i still wished most ardently to stay and learn something of the recluse and his dismal abode .\\n\\n\"let that be as it may ,\" i replied . \"i can\\'t help about other people . but i surely would like to have a spot to stop till daylight . still--if people don\\'t relish this place , mayn\\'t it be because it\\'s getting so run-down ? of course i suppose it would a take a fortune to keep such an estate up , but if the burden\\'s too great why don\\'t you look for smaller quarters ? why try to stick it out here in this way--with all the hardships and discomforts ?\"\\n\\nthe man did not seem offended , but answered me very gravely .\\n\\n\"surely you may stay if you really wish to--you can come to no harm that i know of . but others claim there are certain peculiarly undesirable influences here . as for me--i stay here because i have to . there is something i feel it a duty to guard--something that holds me . i wish i had the money and health and ambition to take decent care of the house and grounds .\"\\n\\nwith my curiosity still more heightened , i prepared to take my host at his word ; and followed him slowly upstairs when he motioned me to do so . it was very dark now , and a faint pattering outside told me that the threatened rain had come . i would have been glad of any shelter , but this was doubly welcome because of the hints of mystery about the place and its master . for an incurable lover of the grotesque , no more fitting haven could have been provided .\\n\\nthere was a second-floor corner room in less unkempt shape than the rest of the house , and into this my host led me , setting down his small lamp and lighting a somewhat larger one . from the cleanliness and contents of the room , and from the books ranged along the walls , i could see that i had not guessed amiss in thinking the man a gentleman of taste and of breeding . he was a hermit and eccentric , no doubt , but he still had standards and intellectual interests . as he waved me to a seat i began a conversation on general topics , and was pleased to find him not at all taciturn . if anything , he seemed glad of someone to talk to , and did not even attempt to swerve the discussion from personal topics .\\n\\nhe was , i learned , one antoine de russy , of an ancient , powerful , and cultivated line of louisiana planters . more than a century ago his grandfather , a younger son , had migrated to southern missouri and founded a new estate in the lavish ancestral manner ; building this pillared mansion and surrounding it with all the accessories of a great plantation . there had been , at one time , as many as 200 negroes in the cabins which stood on the flat ground in the rear--ground that the river had now invaded--and to hear them singing and laughing and playing the banjo at night was to know the fullest charm of a civilization and social order now sadly extinct . in front of the house , where the great guardian oaks and willows stood , there had been a lawn like a broad green carpet , always watered and trimmed and with flagstoned , flower-bordered walks curving through it . \"riverside\"--for such the place was called--had been a lovely and idyllic homestead in its day ; and my host could recall it when many traces of its best period remained .\\n\\nit was raining hard now , with dense sheets of water beating against the insecure roof , walls , and windows , and sending in drops through a thousand chinks and crevices . moisture trickled down to the floor from unsuspected places , and the mounting wind rattled the rotting , loose-hinged shutters outside . but i minded none of this , for i saw that a story was coming . incited to reminiscence , my host made a move to shew me to sleeping-quarters ; but kept on recalling the older , better days . soon , i saw , i would receive an inkling of why he lived alone in that ancient place , and why his neighbours thought it full of undesirable influences . his voice was very musical as he spoke on , and his tale soon took a turn which left me no chance to grow drowsy .\\n\\n\"yes--riverside was built in 1816 , and my father was born in 1828 . he\\'d be over a century old now if he were alive , but he died young--so young i can just barely remember him . in \\'64 that was--he was killed in the war , seventh louisiana infantry c .s .a . , for he went back to the old home to enlist . my grandfather was too old to fight , yet he lived on to be ninety-five , and helped my mother bring me up . a good bringing-up , too--i\\'ll give them credit . we always had strong traditions--high notions of honor--and my grandfather saw to it that i grew up the way de russys have grown up , generation after generation , ever since the crusades . we weren\\'t quite wiped out financially , but managed to get on very comfortable after the war . i went to a good school in louisiana , and later to princeton . later on i was able to get the plantation on a fairly profitable basis--though you see what it\\'s come to now .\\n\\n\"my mother died when i was twenty , and my grandfather two years later . it was rather lonely after that ; and in \\'85 i married a distant cousin in new orleans . things might have been different if she\\'d lived , but she died when my son denis was born . then i had only denis . i didn\\'t try marriage again , but gave all my time to the boy . he was like me--like all the de russys--darkish and tall and thin , and with the devil of a temper . i gave him the same training my grandfather had give me , but he didn\\'t need much training when it came to points of honor . it was in him , i reckon . never saw such high spirit--all i could do to keep him from running away to the spanish war when he was eleven ! romantic young devil , too--full of high notions--you\\'d call \\'em victorian , now--no trouble at all to make him let the nigger wenches alone . i sent him to the same school i\\'d gone to , and to princeton , too . he was class of 1909 .\\n\\n\"in the end he decided to be a doctor , and went a year to the harvard medical school . then he hit on the idea of keeping to the old french tradition of the family , and argued me into sending him across to the sorbonne . i did--and proudly enough , though i knew how lonely i\\'d be with him so far off . would to god i hadn\\'t ! i thought he was the safest kind of boy to be in paris . he had a room in the rue st . jacques--that\\'s near the university in the \\'latin quarter\\'--but according to his letters and his friends he didn\\'t cut up with the gayer dogs at all . the people he knew were mostly young fellows from home--serious students and artists who thought more of their work than of striking attitudes and painting the town red .\\n\\n\"but of course there were lots of fellows who were on a sort of dividing line between serious studies and the devil . the aesthetes--the decadents , you know . experiments in life and sensation--the baudelaire kind of a chap . naturally denis ran up against a good many of these , and saw a good deal of their life . they had all sorts of crazy circles and cults--imitation devil-worship , fake black masses , and the like . doubt if it did them much harm on the whole--probably most of \\'em forgot all about it in a year or two . one of the deepest in this queer stuff was a fellow denis had known at school--for that matter , whose father i\\'d known myself . frank marsh , of new orleans . disciple of lafcadio hearn and gauguin and van gogh--regular epitome of the yellow \\'nineties . poor devil--he had the makings of a great artist , at that .\\n\\n\"marsh was the oldest friend denis had in paris , so as a matter of course they saw a good deal of each other--to talk over old times at st . clair academy , and all that . the boy wrote me a good deal about him , and i didn\\'t see any especial harm when he spoke of the group of mystics marsh ran with . it seems there was some cult of prehistoric egyptian and carthaginian magic having a rage among the bohemian element on the left bank--some nonsensical thing that pretended to reach back to forgotten sources of hidden truth in lost african civilisations--the great zimbabwe , the dead atlantean cities in the haggar region of the sahara--and they had a lot of gibberish concerned with snakes and human hair . at least , i called it gibberish , then . denis used to quote marsh as saying odd things about the veiled facts behind the legend of medusa\\'s snaky locks--and behind the later ptolemaic myth of berenice , who offered up her hair to save her husband-brother , and had it set in the sky as the constellation coma berenices .\\n\\n\"i don\\'t think this business made much impression on denis until the night of the queer ritual at marsh\\'s rooms when he met the priestess . most of the devotees of the cult were young fellows , but the head of it was a young woman who called herself \\'tanit-isis\\'--letting it be known that her real name--her name in this latest incarnation , as she put it--was marceline bedard . she claimed to be the left-handed daughter of marquis de chameaux , and seemed to have been both a petty artist and an artist\\'s model before adopting this more lucrative magical game . someone said she had lived for a time in the west indies--martinique , i think--but she was very reticent about herself . part of her pose was a great show of austerity and holiness , but i don\\'t think the more experienced students took that very seriously .\\n\\n\"denis , though , was far from experienced , and wrote me fully ten pages of slush about the goddess he had discovered . if i\\'d only realised his simplicity i might have done something , but i never thought a puppy infatuation like could mean much . i felt absurdly sure that denis\\' touchy personal honour and family pride would always keep him out of the most serious complications .\\n\\n\"as time went , though , his letters began to make me nervous . he mentioned this marceline more and more , and his friends less and less , and began talking about the \\'cruel and silly way\\' they declined to introduce her to their mothers and sisters . he seems to have asked her no questions about herself , and i don\\'t doubt but that she filled him full of romantic legendry concerning her origin and divine revelations and the way people slighted her . at length i could see that denis was altogether cutting his own crowd and spending the bulk of his time with his alluring priestess . at her especial request he never told the old crowd of their continual meetings ; so nobody over there tried to break the affair up .\\n\\n\"i suppose she thought he was fabulously rich ; for he had the air of a patrician , and people of a certain class think all aristocratic americans are wealthy . in any case , she probably thought this a rare chance to contract a genuine right-handed alliance with a really eligible young man . by the time my nervousness burst into open advice , it was too late . the boy had lawfully married her , and wrote that he was dropping his studies and bringing the woman home to riverside . he said she had made a great sacrifice and resigned her leadership of the magical cult , and that henceforward she would be merely a private gentlewoman--the future mistress of riverside , and mother of de russys to come .\\n\\n\"well , sir , i took it the best way i could . i knew that sophisticated continentals have different standards from our old american ones--and anyway , i really knew nothing against the woman . a charlatan , perhaps , but why necessarily any worse ? i suppose i tried to keep as na\\xc3\\xafve as possible about such things in those days , for the boy\\'s sake . clearly , there was nothing for a man of sense to do but let denis alone so long as his new wife conformed to de russy ways . let her have a chance to prove herself--perhaps she wouldn\\'t hurt the family as much as some might fear . so i didn\\'t raise any objections or ask any penitence . the thing was done , and i stood ready to welcome the boy back , whatever he brought with him .\\n\\n\"they got here three weeks after the telegram telling of marriage . marceline was beautiful--there was no denying that--and i could see how the boy might very well get foolish about her . she did have an air of breeding , and i think to this day she must have had some strains of good blood in her . she was apparently not much over twenty ; of medium size , fairly slim , and as graceful as a tigress in posture and motion . her complexion was a deep olive--like old ivory--and her eyes were large and very dark . she had small , classically regular features--though not quite clean-cut enough to suit my taste--and the most singular braid of jet black hair that i ever saw .\\n\\n\"i didn\\'t wonder that she had dragged the subject of hair into her magical cult , for with that heavy profusion of it the idea must have occurred to her naturally . coiled up , it made her look like some oriental princess in a drawing of aubrey beardsley\\'s . hanging down her back , it came well below her knees and shone in the light as if it had possessed some separate , unholy vitality of its own . i would almost have thought of medusa or berenice myself--without having such things suggested to me--upon seeing and studying that hair .\\n\\n\"sometimes i thought it moved slightly of itself , and tended to arrange itself in distinct ropes or strands , but this may have been sheer illusion . she braided it incessantly , and seemed to use some sort of preparation on it . i got the notion once--a curious , whimsical notion--that it was a living being which she had to feed in some strange way . all nonsense--but it added to my feeling of constraint about her and her hair .\\n\\n\"for i can\\'t deny that i failed to like her wholly , no matter how hard i tried . i couldn\\'t tell what the trouble was , but it was there . something about her repelled me very subtly , and i could not help weaving morbid and macabre associations about everything connected with her . her complexion called up thoughts of babylon , atlantis , lemuria , and the terrible forgotten dominations of an elder world ; her eyes struck me sometimes as the eyes of some unholy forest creature or animal goddess too immeasurably ancient to be fully human ; and her hair--that dense , exotic , overnourished growth of oily inkiness--made one shiver as a great black python might have done . there was no doubt but that she realised my involuntary attitude--though i tried to hide it , and she tried to hide the fact that she noticed it .\\n\\n\"yet the boy\\'s infatuation lasted . he positively fawned on her , and overdid all the little gallantries of daily life to a sickening degree . she appeared to return the feeling , though i could see it took a conscious effort to make her duplicate his enthusiasms and extravagances . for one thing , i think she was piqued to learn we weren\\'t as wealthy as she had expected .\\n\\n\"it was a bad business all told . i could see that sad undercurrents were arising . denis was half-hypnotised with puppy-love , and began to grow away from me as he felt my shrinking from his wife . this kind of thing went on for months , and i saw that i was losing my only son--the boy who had formed the centre of all my thoughts and acts for the past quarter century . i\\'ll own that i felt bitter about it--what father wouldn\\'t ? and yet i could do nothing .\\n\\n\"marceline seemed to be a good wife enough in those early months , and our friends received her without any quibbling or questioning . i was always nervous , though , about what some of the young fellows in paris might write home to their relatives after the news of the marriage spread around . despite the woman\\'s love of secrecy , it couldn\\'t remain hidden forever--indeed , denis had written a few of his closest friends , in strict confidence , as soon as he was settled with her at riverside .\\n\\n\"i got to staying alone in my room more and more , with my failing health as an excuse . it was about that time that my present spinal neuritis began to develop--which made the excuse a pretty good one . denis didn\\'t seem to notice the trouble , or take any interest in me and my habits and affairs ; and it hurt me to see how callous he was getting . i began to get sleepless , and often racked my brain in the night to try to find out what made my new daughter-in-law so repulsive and even dimly horrible to me . it surely wasn\\'t her old mystical nonsense , for she had left all the past behind her and never mentioned it once . she didn\\'t even do any painting , although i understood that she had once dabbled in art .\\n\\n\"oddly , the only ones who seemed to share my uneasiness were the servants . the darkies around the house seemed very sullen in their attitude toward her , and in a few weeks all save the few who were strongly attached to our family had left . these few--old scipio and his wife sarah , the cook delilah , and mary , scipio\\'s daughter--were as civil as possible ; but plainly revealed that their new mistress commanded their duty rather than their affection . they stayed in their own remote part of the house as much as possible . mccabe , our white chauffeur , was insolently admiring rather than hostile ; and another exception was a very old zulu woman , said to have been a sort of leader in her small cabin as a kind of family pensioner . old sophonisba always shewed reverence whenever marceline came near her , and one time i saw her kiss the ground where her mistress had walked . blacks are superstitious animals , and i wondered whether marceline had been talking any of her mystical nonsense to our hands in order to overcome their evident dislike .\\n\\n\"well , that\\'s how we went on for nearly half a year . then , in the summer of 1916 , things began to happen . toward the middle of june denis got a note from his old friend frank marsh , telling of a sort of nervous breakdown which made him want to take a rest in the country . it was postmarked new orleans--for marsh had gone home from paris when he felt the collapse coming on--and seemed a very plain though polite bid for an invitation from us . marsh , of course , knew that marceline was here ; and asked very courteously after her . denis was sorry to hear of his trouble and told him at once to come along for an indefinite visit .\\n\\n\"marsh came--and i was shocked to notice how he had changed since i had seen him in his earlier days . he was a smallish , lightish fellow , with blue eyes and an undecided chin ; and now i could see the effects of drink and i don\\'t know what else in his puffy eyelids , enlarged nose-pores , and heavy lines around the mouth . i reckon he had taken his dose of decadence pretty seriously , and set out to be as much of a rimbaud , baudelaire , or lautreamont as he could . and yet he was delightful to talk to--for like all decadents he was exquisitely sensitive to the color and atmosphere and names of things ; admirably , thoroughly alive , and with whole records of conscious experience in obscure , shadowy fields of living and feeling which most of us pass over without knowing they exist . poor young devil--if only his father had lived longer and taken him in hand ! there was great stuff in the boy !\\n\\n\"i was glad of the visit , for i felt it would help to set up a normal atmosphere in the house again . and that\\'s what it really seemed to do at first ; for as i said , marsh was a delight to have around . he was as sincere and profound an artist as i ever saw in my life , and i certainly believe that nothing on earth mattered to him except the perception and expression of beauty . when he saw an exquisite thing , or was creating one , his eyes would dilate until the light irises were nearly out of sight--leaving two mystical black pits in that weak , delicate , chalk-like face ; black pits opening on strange worlds which none of us could guess about .\\n\\n\"when he reached here , though , he didn\\'t have many chances to shew this tendency ; for he had , as he told denis , gone quite stale . it seems he had been very successful as an artist of a bizarre kind--like fuseli or goya or sime or clark ashton smith--but had suddenly become played out . the world of ordinary things around him had ceased to hold anything he could recognize as beauty--beauty , that is , of enough force and poignancy to arouse his creative faculty . he had often been this way before--all decadents are--but this time he could not invent any new , strange , or outr\\xc3\\xa9 sensation or experience which would supply the needed illusion of fresh beauty or stimulatingly adventurous expectancy . he was like a durtal or a des esseintes at the most jaded point of his curious orbit .\\n\\n\"marceline was away when marsh arrived . she hadn\\'t been enthusiastic about his coming , and had refused to decline an invitation from some of our friends in st . louis which came about that time for her and denis . denis , of course , stayed to receive his guest ; but marceline had gone on alone . it was the first time they had ever been separated , and i hoped the interval would help to dispel the daze that was making such a fool of the boy . marceline shewed no hurry to get back , but seemed to me to prolong her absence as much as she could . denis stood it better than one would have expected from such a doting husband , and seemed more like his old self as he talked over other days with marsh and tried to cheer the listless aesthete up .\\n\\n\"it was marsh who seemed most impatient to see the woman ; perhaps because he thought her strange beauty , or some phase of the mysticism which had gone into her one-time magical cult , might help to reawaken his interest in things and give him another start toward artistic creation . that there was no baser reason , i was absolutely certain from what i knew of marsh\\'s character . with all his weaknesses , he was a gentleman--and it had indeed relieved me when i first learned that he wanted to come here because his willingness to accept denis\\' hospitality proved that there was no reason why he shouldn\\'t .\\n\\n\"when , at last , marceline did return , i could see that marsh was tremendously affected . he did not attempt to make her talk of the bizarre thing which she had so definitely abandoned , but was unable to hide a powerful admiration which kept his eyes--now dilated in that curious way for the first time during his visit--riveted to her every moment she was in the room . she , however , seemed uneasy rather than pleased by his steady scrutiny--that is , she seemed so at first , though this feeling of hers wore away in a few days , and left the two on a basis of the most cordial and voluble congeniality . i could see marsh studying her constantly when he thought no one was watching ; and i wondered how long it would be that only the artist , and not the primitive man , would be aroused by her mysterious graces .\\n\\n\"denis naturally felt some irritation at this turn of affairs ; though he realised that his guest was a man of honour and that , as kindred mystics and aesthetes , marceline and marsh would naturally have things and interests to discuss in which a more or less conventional person could have no part . he didn\\'t hold anything against anybody , but merely regretted that his own imagination was too limited and traditional to let him talk with marceline as marsh talked . at this stage of things i began to see more of the boy . with his wife otherwise busy , he had time to remember that he had a father--and a father who was ready to help him in any sort of perplexity or difficulty .\\n\\n\"we often sat together on the veranda watching marsh and marceline as they rode up or down the drive on horseback , or played tennis on the court that used to stretch south of the house . they talked mostly in french , which marsh , though he hadn\\'t more than a quarter-portion of french blood , handled more glibly than either denis or i could speak it . marceline\\'s english , always academically correct , was rapidly improving in accent ; but it was plain that she relished dropping back into her mother-tongue . as we looked at the congenial couple they made , i could see the boy\\'s cheek and throat muscles tighten--though he wasn\\'t a whit less ideal a host to marsh , or a whit less considerate husband to marceline .\\n\\n\"all this was generally in the afternoon ; for marceline rose very late , had breakfast in bed , and took an immense amount of time preparing to come downstairs . i never knew of anyone so wrapped up in cosmetics , beauty exercises , hair-oils , unguents , and everything of that kind . it was in these morning hours that denis and marsh did their real visiting , and exchanged the close confidences which kept their friendship up despite the strain that jealousy imposed .\\n\\n\"well , it was in one of those morning talks on the veranda that marsh made the proposition which brought on the end . i was laid up with some of my neuritis , but had managed to get downstairs and stretch out on the front parlour sofa near the long window . denis and marsh were just outside ; so i couldn\\'t help hearing all they said . they had been talking about art , and the curious , capricious elements needed to jolt an artist into producing the real article , when marsh suddenly swerved from abstractions to the personal application he must have had in mind from the start .\\n\\n\"\\'i suppose ,\\' he was saying , \\'that nobody can tell just what it is in some scenes or objects that makes them aesthetic stimuli for certain individuals . basically , of course , it must have some reference to each man\\'s background of stored-up mental associations , for no two people have the same scale of sensitiveness and responses . we decadents are artists for whom all ordinary things have ceased to have any emotional or imaginative significance , but no one of us responds in the same way to exactly the same extraordinary . now take me , for instance .\\'\"\\n\\n\"he paused and resumed .\\n\\n\"\\'i know , denny , that i can say these things to you because you such a preternaturally unspoiled mind--clean , fine , direct , objective , and all that . you won\\'t misunderstand as an oversubtilised , effete man of the world might .\\'\"\\n\\n\"he paused once more .\\n\\n\"\\'the fact is , i think i know what\\'s needed to set my imagination working again . i\\'ve had a dim idea of it ever since we were in paris , but i\\'m sure now . it\\'s marceline , old chap--that face and that hair , and the train of shadowy images they bring up . not merely visible beauty--though god knows there\\'s enough of that--but something peculiar and individualised , that can\\'t exactly be explained . do you know , in the last few days i\\'ve felt the existence of such a stimulus so keenly that i honestly think i could outdo myself--break into the real masterpiece class if i could get ahold of paint and canvas at just the time when her face and hair set my fancy stirring and weaving . there\\'s something weird and other-worldly about it--something joined up with the dim ancient thing marceline represents . i don\\'t know how much she\\'s told you about that side of her , but i can assure you there\\'s plenty of it . she has some marvellous links with the outside .\\'\\n\\n\"some change in denis\\' expression must have halted the speaker here , for there was a considerable spell of silence before the words went on . i was utterly taken aback , for i\\'d expected no such overt development like this ; and i wondered what my son could be thinking . my heart began to pound violently , and i strained my ears in the frankest of intentional eavesdropping . then marsh resumed .\\n\\n\"\\'of course you\\'re jealous--i know how a speech like mine must sound--but i can swear to you that you needn\\'t be .\\'\\n\\n\"denis did not answer , and marsh went on .\\n\\n\"\\' to tell the truth , i could never be in love with marceline--i couldn\\'t even be a cordial friend of hers in the warmest sense . why , damn it all , i felt like a hypocrite talking with her these days as i\\'ve been doing .\\n\\n\"\\'the case simply is , that one of her phase of her half hyponotises me in a certain way--a very strange , fantastic , and dimly terrible way--just as another phase half hypnotises you in a much more normal way . i see something in her--or to be psychologically exact , something through her or beyond her--that you didn\\'t see at all . something that brings up a vast pageantry of shapes from forgotten abysses , and makes me want to paint incredible things whose outlines vanish the instant i try to envisage them clearly . don\\'t mistake , denny , your wife is a magnificent being , a splendid focus of cosmic forces who has a right to be called divine if anything on earth has !\\'\\n\\n\"i felt a clearing of the situation at this point , for the abstract strangeness of marsh\\'s statement , plus the flattery he was now heaping on marceline , could not fail to disarm and mollify one as fondly proud of his consort as denis always was . marsh evidently caught the change himself , for there was more confidence in his tone as he continued .\\n\\n\"\\'i must paint her , denny--must paint that hair--and you won\\'t regret . there\\'s something more than mortal about that hair--something more than beautiful--\\'\\n\\n\"he paused , and i wondered what denis could be thinking . i wondered , indeed , what i was really thinking myself . was marsh\\'s interest actually that of the artist alone , or was he merely infatuated as denis had been ? i had thought , in their schooldays , that he had envied my boy ; and i dimly felt that it might be the same now . on the other hand , something in that talk of artistic stimulus had rung amazingly true ; so that the more i pondered , the more i was inclined to take the stuff at face value . denis seemed to do so , too , for although i could not catch his low-spoken reply , i could tell by the effect it produced that it must have been affirmative .\\n\\n\"there was a sound of someone slapping another on the back , and then a grateful speech from marsh that i was long to remember .\\n\\n\"\\'that\\'s great , denny , and just as i told you , you\\'ll never regret it . in a sense , i\\'m half doing it for you . you\\'ll be a different man when you see it . i\\'ll put you back where you used to be--give you a waking-up and a sort of salvation--but you can\\'t see what i mean as yet . just remember old friendship , and don\\'t get the idea that i\\'m not the same old bird !\\'\\n\\n\"i rose perplexedly as i saw the two stroll off across the lawn , arm in arm , and smoking in unison . what could marsh have meant by his strange and almost ominous reassurance ? the more my fears were quieted in one direction , the more they were aroused in another . look at it any way i could , it seemed to be a rather bad business .\\n\\n\"but matters got started just the same . denis fixed up an attic room with skylights , and marsh sent for all sorts of painting equipment . everyone was rather excited about the new venture , and i was at least glad that something was on foot to break the brooding tension . soon the sittings began , and we all took them quite seriously--for we could see that marsh regarded them as important artistic events . denny and i used to go quietly about the house as though something sacred were occurring , and we knew that it was sacred as far as marsh was concerned .\\n\\n\"with marceline , though , it was a different matter , as i began to see at once . whatever marsh\\'s reactions to the sittings may have been , hers were painfully obvious . every possible way she betrayed a frank and commonplace infatuation for the artist , and would repulse denis\\' marks of affection whenever she dared . oddly , i noticed this more vividly than denis himself , and tried to devise some plan for keeping the boy\\'s mind easy until the matter could be straightened out . there was no use in having him excited about it if it could be helped .\\n\\n\"in the end i decided that denis had better be away while the disagreeable situation existed . i could represent his interests well enough at this end , and sooner or later marsh would finish the picture and go . my view of marsh\\'s honour was such that i did not look for any worse developments . when the matter had blown over , and marceline had forgotten about her new infatuation , it would be time enough to have denis on hand again .\\n\\n\"so i wrote a long letter to my marketing and financial agent in new york , and cooked up a plan to have the boy summoned there for an indefinite time . i had the agent write him that our affairs absolutely required one of us to go east , and of course my illness made it clear that i could not be the one . it was arranged that when denis got to new york he would find enough plausible matters to keep him busy as long as i thought he ought to be away .\\n\\n\"the plan worked perfectly , and denis started for new york without the least suspicion ; marceline and marsh going with him in the car to cape girardeau , where he caught the afternoon train to st . louis . they returned after dark , and as mccabe drove the car back to the stables i could hear them talking on the veranda--in those same chairs near the long parlour window where marsh and denis had sat when i overheard them talk about the portrait . this time i resolved to do some intentional eavesdropping , so quietly went down to the front parlour and stretched out on the sofa near the window .\\n\\n\"at first i could not hear anything but very shortly there came the sound of a chair being shifted , followed by a short , sharp breath and a sort of inarticulately hurt exclamation from marceline . then i heard marsh speaking in a strained , almost formal voice .\\n\\n\"\\'i\\'d enjoy working tonight if you aren\\'t too tired .\\'\\n\\n\"marceline\\'s reply was in the same hurt tone which had marked her exclamation . she used english as he had done .\\n\\n\"\\'oh , frank , is that really all you care about ? forever working ! can\\'t we just sit out here in this glorious moonlight ?\\'\\n\\n\"he answered impatiently , his voice shewing a certain contempt beneath the dominant quality of artistic enthusiasm .\\n\\n\"\\'moonlight ! good god , what cheap sentimentality ! for a supposedly sophisticated person you surely do hang on to some of the crudest claptrap that ever escaped from the dime novels ! with art at your elbow , you have to think of the moon--cheap as a spotlight at the varieties ! or perhaps it makes you think of the roodmas dance around the stone pillars at auteiul . hell , how you used to make those goggle-eyed yaps stare ! but not--i suppose you\\'ve dropped all that now . no more atlantean magic or hair-snake rites for madame de russy ! i\\'m the only one to remember the ld things--the things that came down through the temples of tanit and echoed on the ramparts of zimbabwe . but i won\\'t be cheated of that remembrance--all that is weaving itself into the thing on my canvas--the thing that is going to capture wonder and crystallise the secrets of 75 ,000 years .\\'\\n\\n\"marceline interrupted in a voice full of mixed emotions .\\n\\n\"\\'it\\'s you who are cheaply sentimental now ! you know well that the old things had better be let alone . all of you had better watch out if ever i chant the old rites or try to call up what lies hidden in yuggoth , zimbabwe , and r\\'lyeh . i thought you had more sense !\\n\\n\"\\'you lack logic . you want me to be interested in this precious painting of yours , yet you never let me see what you\\'re doing . always that black cloth over it ! it\\'s of me--i shouldn\\'t think it would matter if i saw it .\\'\\n\\n\"marsh was interrupting this time , his voice curiously hard and strained .\\n\\n\"\\'no . not now . you\\'ll see it in due course of time . you say it\\'s of you--yes , it\\'s that , but it\\'s more . if you knew , you mightn\\'t be so impatient . poor denis ! my god , it\\'s a shame !\\'\\n\\n\"my throat was suddenly dry as the words rose to an almost febrile pitch . what could marsh mean ? suddenly i saw that he had stopped and was entering the house alone . i heard the front door slam , and listened as his footsteps ascended the stairs . outside on the veranda i could still hear marceline\\'s heavy , angry breathing . i crept away sick at heart , feeling that there were grave things to ferret out before i could safely let denis come back .\\n\\n\"after that evening the tension around the place was even worse than before . marceline had always lived on flattery and fawning and the shock of those few blunt words from marsh was too much for her temperament . there was no living in the house with her anymore , for with poor denis gone she took out her abusiveness on everybody . when she could find no one indoors to quarrel with she would go out to sophonisba\\'s cabin and spend hours talking with the queer old zulu woman . aunt sophy was the only person who would fawn abjectly enough to suit her , and when i tried once to overhear their conversation i found marceline whispering about \\'elder secrets\\' and \\'unknown kadath\\' while the negress rocked to and fro in her chair , making inarticulate sounds of reverence and admiration every now and then .\\n\\n\"but nothing could break her dog-like infatuation for marsh . she would talk bitterly and sullenly to him , yet was getting more and more obedient to his wishes . it was very convenient for him , since he now became able to make her pose for the picture whenever he felt like painting . he tried to shew gratitude for this willingness , but i thought i could detect a kind of contempt or even loathing beneath his careful politeness . for my part , i frankly hated marceline ! there was no use in calling my attitude anything as mild as dislike these days . certainly , i was glad denis was away . his letters , not nearly so frequent as i wished , shewed signs of strain and worry .\\n\\n\"as the middle of august went by i gathered from marsh\\'s remarks that the portrait was nearly done . his mood seemed increasingly sardonic , though marceline\\'s temper improved a bit as the prospect of seeing the thing tickled her vanity . i can still recall the day when marsh said he\\'d have everything finished within a week . marceline brightened up perceptibly , though not without a venomous look at me . it seemed as if her coiled hair visibly tightened around her head .\\n\\n\"\\'i\\'m to be the first to see it !\\' she snapped . then , smiling at marsh , she said , \\'and if i don\\'t like it i shall slash it to pieces !\\'\\n\\n\"marsh\\'s face took on the most curious look i have ever seen it wear as he answered her .\\n\\n\"\\'i can\\'t vouch for your taste , marceline , but i swear it will be magnificent ! not that i want to take much credit--art creates itself--and this thing had to be done . just wait !\\'\"\\n\\n\"during the next few days i felt a queer sense of foreboding , as if the completion of the picture meant a kind of catastrophe instead of a relief . denis , too , had not written me , and my agent in new york said he was planning some trip to the country . i wondered what the outcome of the whole thing would be . what a queer mixture of elements--marsh and marceline , denis and i ! how would all these ultimately react on one another ? when my fears grew too great i tried to lay them all to my infirmity , but that explanation never quite satisfied me .\"\\n\\n\"well , the thing exploded on tuesday , the twenty-sixth of august . i had risen at my usual time and had breakfast , but was not good for much because of the pain in my spine . it had been troubling me badly of late , and forcing me to take opiates when it got too unbearable ; nobody else was downstairs except the servants , though i could hear marceline moving about in her room . marsh slept in the attic next his studio , and had begun to keep such late hours that he was seldom up till noon . about ten o\\'clock the pain got the better of me , so that i took a double dose of my opiate and lay down on the parlour sofa . the last i heard was marceline\\'s pacing overhead . poor creature--if i had known ! she must have been walking before the long mirror admiring herself . that was like her . vain from start to finish--revelling in her own beauty , just as she revelled in all the little luxuries denis was able to give her .\\n\\n\"i didn\\'t wake up till near sunset , and knew instantly how long i had slept from the golden light and long shadows outside the long window . nobody was about , and a sort of unnatural stillness seemed to be hovering over everything . from afar , though , i thought i could sense a faint howling , wild and intermittent , whose quality had a slight but baffling familiarity about it . i\\'m not much for psychic premonitions , but i was frightfully uneasy from the start . there had been dreams--even worse than the ones i had been dreaming in the weeks before--and this time they seemed hideously linked to some black and festering reality . the whole place had a poisonous air . afterward i reflected that certain sounds must have filtered through into my unconscious brain during those hours of drugged sleep . my pain , though , was very much eased ; and i rose and walked without difficulty .\\n\\n\"soon enough i began to see that something was wrong . marsh and marceline might have been riding , but someone ought to have been getting dinner in the kitchen . instead , there was only silence , except for that faint , distant howl or wail ; and nobody answered when i pulled the old-fashioned bell-cord to summon scipio . then , chancing to look up , i saw the spreading stain on the ceiling--the bright red stain , that must have come through the floor of marceline\\'s room .\\n\\n\"in an instant i forgot my crippled back and hurried upstairs to find out the worst . everything under the sun raced through my mind as i struggled with the dampness-warped door of that silent chamber , and most hideous of all was a terrible sense of malign fulfilment and fatal expectedness . i had , it struck me , known all along that nameless horrors were gathering ; that something profoundly and cosmically evil had gained a foot-hold under my roof from which only blood and tragedy could result .\\n\\n\"the door gave at last , and i stumbled into the large room beyond--all dim from the branches of the great trees outside the windows . for a moment i could do nothing but flinch at the faint evil odour that immediately struck my nostrils . then , turning on the electric light and glancing around , i glimpsed a nameless blasphemy on the yellow and blue rug .\\n\\n\"it lay face down in a great pool of dark , thickened blood , and had the gory print of a shod human foot in the middle of its naked back . blood was spattered everywhere--on the walls , furniture , and floor . my knees gave way as i took in the sight , so that i had to stumble to a chair and slump down . the thing had obviously been a human being , though its identity was not easy to establish at first ; since it was without clothes , and had most of its hair hacked and torn from the scalp in a very crude way . it was of a deep ivory colour , and i knew that it must have been marceline . the shoe-print on the back made the thing seem all the more hellish . i could not even picture the strange , loathsome tragedy which must have taken place while i slept in the room below . when i raised my hand to wipe my dripping forehead i saw that my fingers were sticky with blood . i shuddered , then realised that it must have come from the knob of the door which the unknown murderer had forced shut behind him as he left . he had taken his weapon with him , it seemed , for no instrument of death was visible here .\\n\\n\"as i studied the floor i saw that a line of sticky footprints like the one on the body led away from the horror to the door . there was another blood-trail , too , and of a less easily explainable kind ; a broadish , continuous line , as if marking the path of some huge snake . at first i concluded it must be due to something the murderer had dragged after him . then , noting the way some of the footprints seemed to be superimposed on it , i was forced to believe that it could have been there when the murderer left . but what crawling entity could have been in that room with the victim and her assassin , leaving before the killer when the deed was done ? as i asked myself this question i thought i heard fresh bursts of that faint , distant wailing .\\n\\n\"finally , rousing myself from a lethargy of horror , i got on my feet again and began following the footprints . who the murderer was , i could not even faintly guess , nor could i try to explain the absence of the servants . i vaguely felt that i ought to go up to marsh\\'s attic quarters , but before i had fully formulated the idea i saw that the bloody trail was indeed taking me there . was he himself the murderer ? had he gone mad under the strain of the morbid situation and suddenly run amok ?\\n\\n\"in the attic corridor the trail became faint , the prints almost ceasing as they merged with the dark carpet . i could still , however , discern the strange single path of the entity who had gone first ; and this led straight to the closed door of marsh\\'s studio , disappearing beneath it at a point about half way from side to side . evidently it had crossed the threshold at a time when the door was wide open .\\n\\n\"sick at heart , i tried the knob and found the door unlocked . opening it , i paused in the waning north light to see what fresh nightmare might be awaiting me . there was certainly something human on the floor , and i reached for the switch to turn on the chandelier .\\n\\n\"but as the light flashed up my gaze left the floor and its horror--that was marsh , poor devil--to fix itself frantically and incredulously upon the living thing that cowered and stared in the open doorway leading to marsh\\'s bedroom . it was a tousled , wild-eyed thing , crusted with dried blood and carrying in its hand a wicked machete which had been one of the ornaments of the studio wall . yet even in that awful moment i recognised it as one whom i had thought more than a thousand miles away . it was my own boy denis--or the maddened wreck which had once been denis .\\n\\n\"the sight of me seemed to bring back a trifle of sanity--or at least of memory--in the poor boy . he straightened up and began to toss his head about as if trying to shake free from some enveloping influence . i could not speak a word , but moved my lips in an effort to get back my voice . my eyes wandered for a moment to the figure on the floor in front of the heavily draped easel--the figure toward which the strange blood-trail led , and which seemed to be tangled in the coils of some dark , ropy object . the shifting of my glance apparently produced some impression in the twisted brain of the boy , for suddenly he began to mutter in a hoarse whisper whose purport i was soon able to catch .\\n\\n\"\\'i had to exterminate her--she was the devil--the summit and high-priestess of all evil--the spawn of the pit--marsh knew , and tried to warn me . good old frank--i didn\\'t kill him , though i was ready to before i realised . but i went down there and killed her--then that cursed hair--\\'\\n\\n\"i listened in horror as denis choked , paused , and began again .\\n\\n\"\\'you didn\\'t know--her letters got queer and i knew she was in love with marsh . then she nearly stopped writing . he never mentioned her--i felt something was wrong , and thought i ought to come back and find out . couldn\\'t tell you--your manner would have given it away . wanted to surprise them . got here about noon today--came in a cab and sent the house-servants all off--let the field hands alone , for their cabins are all out of earshot . told mccabe to get me some things in cape girardeau and not bother to come back until tomorrow . had all the niggers take the old car and let mary drive them to bend village for a vacation--told \\'em we were all going on some sort of outing and wouldn\\'t need help . said they\\'d better stay all night with uncle scip\\'s cousin , who keeps that nigger boarding house .\\'\\n\\n\"denis was getting very incoherent now , and i strained my ears to grasp every word . again i thought i heard that wild , far-off wail , but the story had first place for the present .\\n\\n\"\\'saw you sleeping in the parlour , and took a chance you wouldn\\'t wake up . then went upstairs on the quiet to hunt up marsh and that woman !\\'\\n\\n\"the boy shuddered as he avoided pronouncing marceline\\'s name . at the same time i saw his eyes dilate in unison with a bursting of the distant crying , whose vague familiarity had now become very great .\\n\\n\"\\'she was not in her room , so i went up to the studio . door was shut , and i could hear voices inside . didn\\'t knock--just burst in and found her posing for the picture . nude , but with the hellish hair all draped around her . and making all sorts of sheep\\'s eyes at marsh . he had the easel turned half away from the door , so i couldn\\'t see the picture . both of them were pretty well jolted when i shewed up , and marsh dropped his brush . i was in a rage and told him he\\'d have to shew me the portrait , but he got calmer every minute . told me it wasn\\'t quite done , but would be in a day or two--said i could see it then--she--hadn\\'t seen it .\\n\\n\"\\'but that didn\\'t go with me . i stepped up , and he dropped a velvet curtain over the thing before i could see it . he was ready to fight before letting me see it , but that--that--she--stepped up and sided with me . said we ought to see it . frank got horrible worked up , and gave me a punch when i tried to get at the curtain . i punched back and seemed to have knocked him out . then i was almost knocked out myself by the shriek that--that creature--gave . she\\'d drawn aside the hangings herself , and caught a look at what marsh had been painting . i wheeled around and saw her rushing like mad out of the room--then i saw the picture .\\'\\n\\n\"madness flared up in the boy\\'s eyes again as he got to this place , and i thought for a minute he was going to spring at me with his machete . but after a pause he partly steadied himself .\\n\\n\"\\'oh , god--that thing ! don\\'t ever look at it ! burn it with the hangings around it and throw the ashes into the river ! marsh knew--and was warning me . he knew what it was--what that woman--that leopardess , or gorgon , or lamia , or whatever she was--actually represented . he\\'d tried to hint to me ever since i met her in his paris studio , but it couldn\\'t be told in words . i thought they all wronged her when they whispered horrors about her--she had me hypnotised so that i couldn\\'t believe the plain facts--but this picture has caught the whole secret--the whole monstrous background !\\n\\n\"\\'god , but frank is an artist ! that thing is the greatest piece any living soul has produced since rembrandt ! it\\'s a crime to burn it--but it would be a greater crime to let it exist--just as it would have been an abhorrent sin to let--that she-daemon--exist any longer . the minute i saw it i understood what--she--was , and what part she played in the frightful secret that has come down from the days of cthulhu and the elder ones--the secret that was nearly wiped out when atlantis sank , but that kept half alive in hidden traditions and allegorical myths and furtive , midnight cult-practices . for you know she was the real thing . it wasn\\'t any fake . it would have been merciful if it had been a fake . it was the old , hideous shadow that philosophers never dared mention--the thing hinted at in the necronomicon and symbolised in the easter island colossi .\\n\\n\"\\'she thought we couldn\\'t see through--that the false front would hold till we had bartered away our immortal souls . and she was half right--she\\'d have got me in the end . she was only--waiting . but frank--good old frank--was too much for me . he knew what it all meant , and painted it . i don\\'t wonder she shrieked and ran off when she saw it . it wasn\\'t quite done , but god knows enough was there .\\n\\n\"\\'then i knew i\\'d got to kill her--kill her , and everything connected with her . it was a taint that wholesome human blood couldn\\'t bear . there was something else , too--but you\\'ll never know that if you burn the picture without looking . i staggered down to her room with this machete that i got off the wall here , leaving frank still knocked out . he was breathing , though , and i knew and thanked heaven i hadn\\'t killed him .\\n\\n\"\\'i found her in front of the mirror braiding that accursed hair . she turned on me like a wild beast , and began spitting out her hatred of marsh . the fact that she\\'d been in love with him--and i knew she had--only made it worse . for a minute i couldn\\'t move , and she came within an ace of completely hypnotising me . then i thought of the picture , and the spell broke . she saw the breaking in my eyes , and must have noticed the machete , too . i never saw anything give such a wild jungle beast look as she did then . she sprang for me with claws out like a leopard\\'s , but i was too quick . i swung the machete , and it was all over .\\'\\n\\n\"denis had to stop again , and i saw the perspiration running down his forehead through the spattered blood . but in a moment he hoarsely resumed .\\n\\n\"\\'i said it was all over--but god ! some of it had only just begun ! i felt i had fought the legions of satan , and put my foot on the back of the thing i had annihilated . then i saw that blasphemous braid of coarse black hair begin to twist and squirm of itself .\\n\\n\"\\'i might have known it . it was all in the old tales . that damnable hair had a life of its own , that couldn\\'t be ended by killing the creature itself . i knew i\\'d have to burn it , so i started to hack it off with the machete . god , but it was devilish work ! tough--like iron wires--but i managed to do it . and it was loathsome the way the big braid writhed and struggled in my grasp .\\n\\n\"\\'about the time i had the last strand cut or pulled off i heard that eldritch wailing from behind the house . you know--it\\'s still going off and on . i don\\'t know what it is , but it must be something springing from this hellish business . it half seems like something i ought to know but can\\'t quite place . it got my nerves the first time i heard it , and i dropped the severed braid in my fright . then , i got a worse fright--for in another second the braid had turned on me and began to strike venomously with one of its ends which had knotted itself up like a sort of grotesque head . i struck out with the machete , and it turned away . then , when i had my breath again , i saw that the monstrous thing was crawling along the floor by itself like a great black snake . i couldn\\'t do anything for a while , but when it vanished through the door i managed to pull myself together and stumble after it . i could follow the broad , bloody trail , and i saw it led upstairs . it brought me here--and may heaven curse me if i didn\\'t see it through the doorway , striking at poor dazed marsh like a maddened rattler as it had struck at me , finally coiling around him as a python would . he had begun to come to , but that abominable serpent got him before he was on his feet . i knew that all of the woman\\'s hatred was behind it , but i hadn\\'t the power to pull it off . i tried , but it was too much for me . even the machete was no good--i couldn\\'t swing it freely or it would have slashed frank to pieces . so i saw those monstrous coils tighten--saw poor frank crushed to death before my eyes--and all the time that awful faint howling came from somewhere beyond the fields .\\n\\n\"\\'that\\'s all . i pulled the velvet cloth over the picture and hope it\\'ll never be lifted . the thing must be burnt . i couldn\\'t pry the coils off poor , dead frank--they cling to him like a leech , and seem to have lost their motion altogether . it\\'s as if that snaky rope of hair has a kind of perverse fondness for the man it killed--it\\'s clinging to him--embracing him . you\\'ll have to burn poor frank with it--but for god\\'s sake don\\'t forget to see it in ashes . that and the picture . they must both go . the safety of the world demands that they go .\\n\\n\"denis might have whispered more , but a fresh burst of distant wailing cut us short . for the first time we knew what it was , for a westerly veering wind brought articulate words at last . we ought to have known long before , since sounds much like it had often come from the same source . it was wrinkled sophonisba , the ancient zulu witch-woman who had fawned on marceline , keening from her cabin in a way which crowned the horrors of this nightmare tragedy . we could both hear some of the things she howled , and knew that secret and primordial bonds linked this savage sorceress with that other inheritor of elder secrets who had just been extirpated . some of the words she used betrayed her closeness to daemonic and palaeogean traditions .\\n\\n\"\\'i\\xc3\\xa4 ! i\\xc3\\xa4 ! shub-niggurath ! ya-r\\'lyeh ! n\\'gagi n\\'bulu bwana n\\'lolo ! ya , yo , poor missy tanit , poor missy isis ! marse clooloo , come up outen de water an\\' git yo chile--she done daid ! she done daid ! de hair ain\\' got no missus no mo\\' , marse

! i\\xc3\\xa4 ! shub-niggurath ! she daid ! ol\\' sophy know !\\'\\n\\n\"that wasn\\'t the end of the wailing , but it was all i could pay attention to . the expression on my boy\\'s face shewed that it had reminded him of something frightful , and the tightening of his hand on the machete boded no good . i knew he was desperate , and sprang to disarm him before he could do anything more .\\n\\n\"but i was too late . an old man with a bad spine doesn\\'t count for much physically . there was a terrible struggle , but he had done for himself before many seconds were over . i\\'m not sure yet but that he tried to kill me , too . his last panting words were something about the need of wiping out everything that had been connected with marceline , either by blood or marriage .\"\\n\\n\"i wonder to this day that i didn\\'t go stark mad in that instant--or in the moments and hours afterward . in front of me was the slain body of my boy--the only human being i had to cherish--and ten feet away , in front of that shrouded easel , was the body of his best friend , with a nameless coil of horror wound around it . below was the scalped corpse of that she-monster , about whom i was half-ready to believe anything . i was too dazed to analyse the probability of the hair story--and even if i had not been , that dismal howling coming from aunt sophy\\'s cabin would have been enough to quiet doubt for the nonce .\\n\\n\"if i\\'d been wise , i\\'d have done just what poor denis told me to--burned the picture and the body-grasping hair at once and without curiosity--but i was too shaken to be wise . i suppose i muttered foolish things over my boy--and then i remembered that the night was wearing on and that the servants would be back in the morning . it was plain that a matter like this could never be explained , and i knew that i must cover things up and invent a story .\\n\\n\"that coil of hair around marsh was a monstrous thing . as i poked at it with a sword which i took from the wall i almost thought i felt it tighten its grip on the dead man . i didn\\'t dare touch it--and the longer i looked at it the more horrible things i noticed about it . one thing gave me a start . i won\\'t mention it--but it partly explained the need for feeding the hair with queer oils as marceline had always done .\\n\\n\"in the end i decided to bury all three bodies in the cellar--with quicklime , which i knew we had in the storehouse . it was a night of hellish work . i dug three graves--my boy\\'s a long way from the other two , for i didn\\'t want him to be near either the woman\\'s body or her hair . i was sorry i couldn\\'t get the coil from around poor marsh . it was terrible work getting them all down to the cellar . i used blankets in carting the woman and the poor devil with the coil around him . then i had to get two barrels of lime from the storehouse . god must have given me strength , for i not only moved them but filled all three graves without a hitch .\\n\\n\"some of the lime i made into whitewash . i had to take a stepladder and fix over the parlour ceiling where the blood had oozed through . and i burned nearly everything in marceline\\'s room , scrubbing the walls and floor and heavy furniture . i washed up the attic studio , too , and the trail and footprints that led there . and all the time i could hear old sophy\\'s wailing in the distance . the devil must have been in that creature to let her voice go on like that . but she always was howling queer things . that\\'s why the field niggers didn\\'t get scared or curious that night . i locked the studio door and took the key to my room . then i burned all my stained clothes in the fireplace . by dawn the whole house looked quite normal so far as any casual eye could tell . i hadn\\'t dared touch the covered easel , but meant to attend to that later .\\n\\n\"well , the servants came back the next day , and i told them all the young folks had gone to st . louis . none of the field hands seemed to have seen or heard anything , and old sophonisba\\'s wailing had stopped at the instant of sunrise . she was like a sphinx after that , and never let out a word of what had been on her brooding brain the day and night before .\\n\\n\"later on i pretended that denis and marsh and marceline had gone back to paris and had a certain discreet agency mail me letters from there--letters i had fixed up in forged handwriting . it took a good deal of deceit and reticence in several things to various friends , and i knew people have secretly suspected me of holding something back . i had the deaths of marsh and denis reported during the war , and later said marceline had entered a convent . fortunately marsh was an orphan whose eccentric ways had alienated him from his people in louisiana . things might have been patched up a good deal better for me if i had had the sense to burn the picture , sell the plantation , and give up trying to manage things with a shaken and overstrained mind . you see what my folly has brought me to . failing crops--hands discharged one by one--place falling apart to ruin--and myself a hermit and a target for dozens of queer countryside stories . nobody will come around here after dark anymore--or any other time if it can be helped . that\\'s why i knew you must be a stranger .\\n\\n\"and why do i stay here ? i can\\'t wholly tell you that . it\\'s bound up too closely with things at the very rim of sane reality . it wouldn\\'t have been so , perhaps , if i hadn\\'t looked at the picture . i ought to have done as poor denis told me . i honestly meant to burn it when i went up to that locked studio a week after the horror , but i looked first--and that changed everything .\\n\\n\"no--there\\'s no use telling what i saw . you can , in a way , see for yourself presently ; though time and dampness have done their work . i don\\'t think it can hurt you if you want to take a look , but it was different with me . i knew too much of what it all meant .\\n\\n\"denis had been right--it was the greatest triumph of human art since rembrandt , even though still unfinished . i grasped that at the start , and knew that poor marsh had justified his decadent philosophy . he was to painting what baudelaire was to poetry--and marceline was the key that had unlocked his inmost stronghold of genius .\\n\\n\"the thing almost stunned me when i pulled aside the hangings--stunned me before i half knew what the whole thing was . you know , it\\'s only partly a portrait . marsh had been pretty literal when he hinted that he wasn\\'t painting marceline alone , but what he saw through her and beyond her .\\n\\n\"of course she was in it--was the key to it , in a sense--but her figure only formed one point in a vast composition . she was nude except for that hideous web of hair spun around her , and was half-seated , half-reclining on a sort of bench or divan , carved in patterns unlike those of any known decorative tradition . there was a monstrously shaped goblet in one hand , from which was spilling fluid whose colour i haven\\'t been able to place or classify to this day--i don\\'t know where marsh even got the pigments .\\n\\n\"the figure and the divan were in the left-hand foreground of the strangest sort of scene i ever saw in my life . i think there was a faint suggestion of its all being a kind of emanation from the woman\\'s brain , yet there was also a directly opposite suggestion--as if she were just an evil image or hallucination conjured up by the scene itself .\\n\\n\"i can\\'t tell you know whether it\\'s an exterior or an interior--whether those hellish cyclopean vaultings are seen from the outside or the inside , or whether they are indeed carven stone and not merely a morbid fungous arborescence . the geometry of the whole thing is crazy--one gets the acute and obtuse angles all mixed up .\\n\\n\"and god ! the shapes of nightmare that float around in that perpetual daemon twilight ! the blasphemies that lurk and leer and hold a witches\\' sabbat with that woman as a high-priestess ! the black shaggy entities that are not quite goats--the crocodile-headed beast with three legs and a dorsal row of tentacles--and the flat-nosed egyptians dancing in a pattern that egypt\\'s priests knew and called accursed !\\n\\n\"but the scene wasn\\'t egypt--it was behind egypt ; behind even atlantis ; behind fabled mu , and myth--whispered lemuria . it was the ultimate fountainhead of all horror on this earth , and the symbolism shewed only too clearly how integral a part of it marceline was . i think it must be the unmentionable r\\'lyeh , that was not built by any creatures of this planet--the thing marsh and denis used to talk about in the shadows with hushed voices . in the picture it appears that the whole scene is deep under water--though everybody seems to be breathing freely .\\n\\n\"well--i couldn\\'t do anything but look and shudder , and finally i saw that marceline was watching me craftily out of those monstrous , dilated eyes on the canvas . it was no mere superstition--marsh had actually caught something of her horrible vitality in his symphonies of line and color , so that she still brooded and hated , just as if most of her weren\\'t down in the cellar under quicklime . and it was worst of all when some of those hecate-born snaky strands of hair began to lift themselves up from the surface and grope out into the room toward me .\\n\\n\"then it was that i knew the last final horror , and realised i was a guardian and a prisoner forever . she was the thing from which the first dim legends of medusa and the gorgons had sprung , and something in my shaken will had been captured and turned to stone at last . never again would i be safe from those coiling snaky strands--the strands in the picture , and those that lay brooding under the lime near the wine casks . all too late i recalled the tales of the virtual indestructibility , even through centuries of burial , of the hair of the dead .\\n\\n\"my life since has been nothing but horror and slavery . always there had lurked the fear of what broods down in the cellar . in less than a month the niggers began whispering about the great black snake that crawled around near the wine casks after dark , and about the curious way its trail would lead to another spot six feet away . finally i had to move everything to another part of the cellar , for not a darky could be induced to go near the place where the snake was seen .\\n\\n\"then the field hands began talking about the black snake that visited old sophonisba\\'s cabin every night after midnight . one of them shewed me its trail--and not long afterward i found out that aunt sophy herself had begun to pay strange visits to the cellar of the big house , lingering and muttering for hours in the very spot where none of the other blacks would go near . god , but i was glad when that old witch died ! i honestly believe she had been a priestess of some ancient and terrible tradition back in africa . she must have lived to be almost a hundred and fifty years old .\\n\\n\"sometimes i think i hear something gliding around the house at night . there will be a queer noise on the stairs , where the boards are loose , and the latch of my room will rattle as if with an inward pressure . i always keep my door locked , of course . then there are certain mornings when i seem to catch a sickish musty odour in the corridors , and notice a faint , ropy trail through the dust of the floors . i know i must guard the hair in the picture , for if anything were to happen to it , there are entities in this house which would take a sure and terrible revenge . i don\\'t even dare to die--for life and death are all one to those in the clutch of what came out of r\\'lyeh . something would be on hand to punish my neglect . medusa\\'s coil has got me , and it will always be the same . never mix up with secret and ultimate horror , young man , if you value your immortal soul .\"\\n\\nas the old man finished his story i saw that the small lamp had long since burned dry , and that the large one was nearly empty . it must , i knew , be near dawn , and my ears told me that the storm was over . the tale had held me in a half-daze , and i almost feared to glance at the door lest it reveal an inward pressure from some unnamable source . it would be hard to say which had the greatest hold on me--stark horror , incredulity , or a kind of morbid fantastic curiosity . i was wholly beyond speech and had to wait for my strange host to break the spell .\\n\\n\"do you want to see--the thing ?\"\\n\\nhis voice was low and hesitant , and i saw he was tremendously in earnest . of my various emotions , curiosity gained the upper hand ; and i nodded silently . he rose , lighting a candle on a nearby table and holding it high before him as he opened the door .\\n\\n\"come with me--upstairs .\"\\n\\ni dreaded to brave those musty corridors again , but fascination downed all my qualms . the boards creaked beneath our feet , and i trembled once when i thought i saw a faint , rope-like line trace in the dust near the staircase .\\n\\nthe steps of the attic were noisy and rickety , with several of the treads missing . i was just glad of the need of looking sharply to my footing , for it gave me an excuse not to glance about . the attic corridor was pitch-black and heavily cobwebbed , and inch-deep with dust except where a beaten trail led to a door on the left at the farther end . as i noticed the rotting remains of a thick carpet i thought of the other feet which had pressed it in bygone decades--of these , and of one thing which did not have feet .\\n\\nthe old man took me straight to the door at the end of the beaten path , and fumbled a second with the rusty latch . i was acutely frightened now that i knew the picture was so close , yet dared not retreat at this stage . in another moment my host was ushering me into the deserted studio .\\n\\nthe candle light was very faint , yet served to shew most of the principal features . i noticed the low , slanting roof , the huge enlarged dormer , the curios and trophies hung on the wall--and most of all , the great shrouded easel in the centre of the floor . to that easel de russy now walked , drawing aside the dusty velvet hangings on the side turned away from me , and motioning me silently to approach . it took a good deal of courage to make me obey , especially when i saw how my guide\\'s eyes dilated in the wavering candle light as he looked at the unveiled canvas . but again curiosity conquered everything , and i walked around to where de russy stood . then i saw the damnable thing .\\n\\ni did not faint--though no reader can possibly realise the effort it took to keep me from doing so . i did cry out , but stopped short when i saw the frightened look on the old man\\'s face . as i had expected , the canvas was warped , mouldy , and scabrous from dampness and neglect ; but for all that i could trace the monstrous hints of evil cosmic outsideness that lurked all through the nameless scene\\'s morbid content and perverted geometry .\\n\\nit was as the old man had said--a vaulted , columned hell of mumbled black masses and witches\\' sabbaths--and what perfect completion could have added to it was beyond my power to guess . decay had only increased the utter hideousness of its wicked symbolism and diseased suggestion , for the parts most affected by time were just those parts of the picture which in nature--or in the extra-cosmic realm that mocked nature--would be apt to decay and disintegrate .\\n\\nthe utmost horror of all , of course , was marceline--and as i saw the bloated , discoloured flesh i formed the odd fancy that perhaps the figure on the canvas had some obscure , occult linkage with the figure which lay in quicklime under the cellar floor . perhaps the lime had preserved the corpse instead of destroying it--but could it have preserved those black , malign eyes that glared and mocked at me from their painted hell ?\\n\\nand there was something else about the creature which i could not fail to notice--something which de russy had not been able to put into words , but which perhaps had something to do with denis\\' wish to kill all those of his blood who had dwelt under the same roof with her . whether marsh knew , or whether the genius in him painted it without his knowing , none could say . but denis and his father could not have known till they saw the picture .\\n\\nsurpassing all in horror was the streaming black hair--which covered the rotting body , but which was itself not even slightly decayed . all i had heard of it was amply verified . it was nothing human , this ropy , sinuous , half-oily , half-crinkly flood of serpent darkness . vile , independent life proclaimed itself at every unnatural twist and convolution , and the suggestion of numberless reptilian heads at the out-turned ends was far too marked to be illusory or accidental .\\n\\nthe blasphemous thing held me like a magnet . i was helpless , and did not wonder at the myth of the gorgon\\'s glance which turned all beholders to stone . then i thought i saw a change come over the thing . the leering features perceptibly moved , so that the rotting jaw fell , allowing the thick , beast-like lips to disclose a row of pointed yellow fangs . the pupils of the fiendish eyes dilated , and the eyes themselves seemed to bulge outward . and the hair--that accursed hair ! it had begun to rustle and wave perceptibly , the snake-heads all turning toward de russy and vibrating as if to strike !\\n\\nreason deserted me altogether , and before i knew what i was doing i drew my automatic and sent a shower of twelve steel-jacketed bullets through the shocking canvas . the whole thing at once fell to pieces , even the frame toppling from the easel and clattering to the dust-covered floor . but though this horror was shattered , another had risen before me in the form of de russy himself , whose maddened shrieks as he saw the picture vanish were almost as terrible as the picture itself had been .\\n\\nwith a half-articulate scream of \"god , now you\\'ve done it !\" the frantic old man seized me violently by the arm and commenced to drag me out of the room and down the rickety stairs . he had dropped the candle in his panic ; but dawn was near , and some faint grey light was filtering in through the dust-covered windows . i tripped and stumbled repeatedly , but never for a moment would my guide slacken his pace .\\n\\n\"run !\" he shrieked , \"run for your life ! you don\\'t know what you\\'ve done ! i never told you the whole thing ! there were things i had to do--the picture talked to me and told me . i had to guard and keep it--now the worst will happen ! she and that hair will come up out of their graves , for god knows what purpose !\\n\\n\"hurry , man ! for god\\'s sake let\\'s get out of here while there\\'s time . if you have a car take me along to cape girardeau with you . it may well get me in the end , anywhere , but i\\'ll give it a run for its money . out of here--quick !\"\\n\\nas we reached the ground floor i became aware of a slow , curious thumping from the rear of the house , followed by a sound of a door shutting . de russy had not heard the thumping , but the other noise caught his ear and drew from him the most terrible shriek that ever sounded in human throat .\\n\\n\"oh , god--great god--that was the cellar door--she\\'s coming--\"\\n\\nby this time i was desperately wrestling with the rusty latch and sagging hinges of the great front door--almost as frantic as my host now that i heard the slow , thumping tread approaching from the unknown rear rooms of the accursed mansion . the night\\'s rain had warped the oaken planks , and the heavy door stuck and resisted even more strongly than it had when i forced an entrance the evening before .\\n\\nsomewhere a plank creaked beneath the foot of whatever was walking , and the sound seemed to snap the last cord of sanity in the poor old man . with a roar like that of a maddened bull he released his grip on me and made a plunge to the right , through the open door of a room which i judged had been a parlour . a second later , just as i got the front door open and was making my own escape , i heard the tinkling clatter of broken glass and knew he had leapt through a window . and as i bounded off the sagging porch to commence my mad race down the long , weed-grown drive i thought i could catch the thud of dead , dogged footsteps which did not follow me , but which kept leadenly on through the door of the cobwebbed parlour .\\n\\ni looked backward only twice as i plunged heedlessly through the burrs and briers of that abandoned drive , past the dying lindens and grotesque scrub-oaks , in the grey pallor of a cloudy november dawn . the first time was when an acrid smell overtook me , and i thought of the candle de russy had dropped in the attic studio . by then i was comfortably near the road , on the high place from which the roof of the distant house was clearly visible above its encircling trees ; and just as i expected , thick clouds of smoke were billowing out of the attic dormers and curling upward into the leaden heavens . i thanked the powers of creation that an immemorial curse was about to be purged by fire and blotted from the earth .\\n\\nbut in the next instant came that second backward look in which i glimpsed two other things--things that cancelled most of the relief and gave me a supreme shock from which i shall never recover . i have said that i was on a high part of the drive , from which much of the plantation behind me was visible . this vista included not only the house and its trees but some of the abandoned and partly flooded land beside the river , and several bends of the weed-choked drive i had been so hastily traversing . in both of these latter places i now beheld sights--or suspicions of sights--which i wish devoutly i could deny .\\n\\nit was a faint , distant scream which made me turn back again , and as i did so i caught a trace of motion on the dull grey marshy plain behind the house . at that human figures are very small , yet i thought the motion resolved itself into two of these--pursuer and pursued . i even thought i saw the dark-clothed leading figure overtaken , seized , and dragged violently in the direction of the now burning house .\\n\\nbut i could not watch the outcome , for at once a nearer sight obtruded itself--a suggestion of motion among the underbrush at a point some distance back along the deserted drive . unmistakably , the weeds and bushes and briers were swaying as no wind could sway them ; swaying as if some large , swift serpent were wriggling purposefully along on the ground in pursuit of me .\\n\\nthat was all i could stand . i scrambled along madly for the gate , heedless of torn clothing and bleeding scratches , and jumped into the roadster parked under the great evergreen tree . it was a bedraggled , rain-drenched sight ; but the works were unharmed and i had no trouble in starting the thing . i went on blindly in the direction the car was headed for nothing was in my mind but to get away from that frightful region of nightmares and cacodaemons--to get away as quickly and as far as gasoline could take me .\\n\\nabout three or four miles along the road a farmer hailed me--a kindly , drawling fellow of middle age and considerable native intelligence . i was glad to slow down and ask directions , though i knew i must present a strange enough aspect . the man readily told me the way to cape girardeau , and inquired where i had come from in such a state at such an early hour . thinking it best to say little , i merely mentioned that i had been caught in the night\\'s rain and had taken shelter at a nearby farmhouse , afterward losing my way in the underbrush trying to find my car .\\n\\n\"at a farmhouse , eh ? wonder whose it could\\'a been . ain\\'t nothin\\' standin\\' this side o\\' jim ferris\\' place acrost barker\\'s crick , an\\' that\\'s all o\\' twenty miles by the rud .\"\\n\\ni gave a start , and wondered what fresh mystery this portended . then i asked my informant if he had overlooked the large ruined plantation house whose ancient gate bordered the road not far back .\\n\\n\"funny ye sh\\'d recolleck that , stranger ! must a ben here afore some time . but that house ain\\'t here now . burnt down five or six years ago--and they did tell some queer stories about it .\"\\n\\ni shuddered .\\n\\n\"you mean riverside--ol\\' man de russy\\'s place . queer goin\\'s on there fifteen or twenty years ago . ol\\' man\\'s boy married a gal from abroad , and some folks thought she was a mighty odd sort . didn\\'t like the looks of her , then she and the boy went off sudden , and later on the ol\\' man said he was kilt in the war . but some o\\' the niggers hinted queer things . got around at last that the ol\\' fellow fell in love with the gal himself and kilt her and the boy . that place was sure enough haunted by a black snake , mean that what it may .\\n\\n\"then five or six years ago the ol\\' man disappeared and the house burned down . some do say he was burnt up in it . it was a mornin\\' after a rainy night just like this , when lots o\\' folks heard an awful yellin\\' across the fields in old de russy\\'s voice . when they stopped and looked , they see the house goin\\' up in smoke quick as a wink--that place was all like tinder anyhow , rain or no rain . nobody never seen the ol\\' man again , but onct in a while they tell of the ghost of that big black snake glidin\\' aroun\\' .\\n\\n\"what d\\'ye make of it , anyhow ? you seem to hev knowed the place . didn\\'t ye ever hear tell of the de russys ? what d\\'ye reckon was the trouble with that gal young denis married ? she kinder made everybody shiver and feel hateful , though ye couldn\\'t never tell why .\"\\n\\ni was trying to think , but that process was almost beyond me now . the house burned down years ago ? then where , and under what conditions , had i passed the night ? and why did i know what i knew of these things ? even as i pondered i saw a hair on my coat sleeve--the short , grey hair of an old man .\\n\\nin the end i drove on without telling anything . but did i hint that gossip was wronging the poor old planter who had suffered so much . i made it clear--as if from distant but authentic reports wafted among friends--that if anyone was to blame for the trouble at riverside it was the woman , marceline . she was not suited to missouri ways , i said , and it was too bad that denis had ever married her .\\n\\nmore i did not intimate , for i felt that the de russys , with their proudly cherished honour and high , sensitive spirits , would not wish me to say more . they had borne enough , god knows , without the countryside guessing what a daemon of the pit--what a gorgon of the elder blasphemies--had come to flaunt their ancient and stainless name .\\n\\nnor was it right that the neighbours should know that other horror which my strange host of the night could not bring himself to tell me--that horror which he must have learned , as i learned it , from details in the lost masterpiece of poor frank marsh .\\n\\nit would be too hideous if they knew that the one-time heiress of riverside--the accursed gorgon or lamia whose hateful crinkly coil of serpent-hair must even now be brooding and twining vampirically around an artist\\'s skeleton in a lime-packed grave beneath a charred foundation--was faintly , subtly , yet to the eyes of genius unmistakably the scion of zimbabwe\\'s most primal grovellers . no wonder she owned a link with that old witch-woman--for , though in deceitfully slight proportion , marceline was a negress .\\n', shape=(), dtype=string)\n",
            "tf.Tensor(b'facts concerning the late arthur jermyn and his family\\n\\ni\\n\\nlife is a hideous thing , and from the background behind what we know of it peer daemoniacal hints of truth which make it sometimes a thousandfold more hideous . science , already oppressive with its shocking revelations , will perhaps be the ultimate exterminator of our human species--if separate species we be--for its reserve of unguessed horrors could never be borne by mortal brains if loosed upon the world . if we knew what we are , we should do as sir arthur jermyn did ; and arthur jermyn soaked himself in oil and set fire to his clothing one night . no one placed the charred fragments in an urn or set a memorial to him who had been ; for certain papers and a certain boxed object were found which made men wish to forget . some who knew him do not admit that he ever existed .\\n\\narthur jermyn went out on the moor and burned himself after seeing the boxed object which had come from africa . it was this object , and not his peculiar personal appearance , which made him end his life . many would have disliked to live if possessed of the peculiar features of arthur jermyn , but he had been a poet and scholar and had not minded . learning was in his blood , for his great-grandfather , sir robert jermyn , bt . , had been an anthropologist of note , whilst his great--great-great-grandfather , sir wade jermyn , was one of the earliest explorers of the congo region , and had written eruditely of its tribes , animals , and supposed antiquities . indeed , old sir wade had possessed an intellectual zeal amounting almost to a mania ; his bizarre conjectures on a prehistoric white congolese civilisation earning him much ridicule when his book , observation on the several parts of africa , was published . in 1765 this fearless explorer had been placed in a madhouse at huntingdon .\\n\\nmadness was in all the jermyns , and people were glad there were not many of them . the line put forth no branches , and arthur was the last of it . if he had not been , one can not say what he would have done when the object came . the jermyns never seemed to look quite right--something was amiss , though arthur was the worst , and the old family portraits in jermyn house showed fine faces enough before sir wade\\'s time . certainly , the madness began with sir wade , whose wild stories of africa were at once the delight and terror of his few friends . it showed in his collection of trophies and specimens , which were not such as a normal man would accumulate and preserve , and appeared strikingly in the oriental seclusion in which he kept his wife . the latter , he had said , was the daughter of a portuguese trader whom he had met in africa ; and did not like english ways . she , with an infant son born in africa , had accompanied him back from the second and longest of his trips , and had gone with him on the third and last , never returning . no one had ever seen her closely , not even the servants ; for her disposition had been violent and singular . during her brief stay at jermyn house she occupied a remote wing , and was waited on by her husband alone . sir wade was , indeed , most peculiar in his solicitude for his family ; for when he returned to africa he would permit no one to care for his young son save a loathsome black woman from guinea . upon coming back , after the death of lady jermyn , he himself assumed complete care of the boy .\\n\\nbut it was the talk of sir wade , especially when in his cups , which chiefly led his friends to deem him mad . in a rational age like the eighteenth century it was unwise for a man of learning to talk about wild sights and strange scenes under a congo moon ; of the gigantic walls and pillars of a forgotten city , crumbling and vine-grown , and of damp , silent , stone steps leading interminably down into the darkness of abysmal treasure-vaults and inconceivable catacombs . especially was it unwise to rave of the living things that might haunt such a place ; of creatures half of the jungle and half of the impiously aged city--fabulous creatures which even a pliny might describe with scepticism ; things that might have sprung up after the great apes had overrun the dying city with the walls and the pillars , the vaults and the weird carvings . yet after he came home for the last time sir wade would speak of such matters with a shudderingly uncanny zest , mostly after his third glass at the knight\\'s head ; boasting of what he had found in the jungle and of how he had dwelt among terrible ruins known only to him . and finally he had spoken of the living things in such a manner that he was taken to the madhouse . he had shown little regret when shut into the barred room at huntingdon , for his mind moved curiously . ever since his son had commenced to grow out of infancy , he had liked his home less and less , till at last he had seemed to dread it . the knight\\'s head had been his headquarters , and when he was confined he expressed some vague gratitude as if for protection . three years later he died .\\n\\nwade jermyn\\'s son philip was a highly peculiar person . despite a strong physical resemblance to his father , his appearance and conduct were in many particulars so coarse that he was universally shunned . though he did not inherit the madness which was feared by some , he was densely stupid and given to brief periods of uncontrollable violence . in frame he was small , but intensely powerful , and was of incredible agility . twelve years after succeeding to his title he married the daughter of his gamekeeper , a person said to be of gypsy extraction , but before his son was born joined the navy as a common sailor , completing the general disgust which his habits and misalliance had begun . after the close of the american war he was heard of as sailor on a merchantman in the african trade , having a kind of reputation for feats of strength and climbing , but finally disappearing one night as his ship lay off the congo coast .\\n\\nin the son of sir philip jermyn the now accepted family peculiarity took a strange and fatal turn . tall and fairly handsome , with a sort of weird eastern grace despite certain slight oddities of proportion , robert jermyn began life as a scholar and investigator . it was he who first studied scientifically the vast collection of relics which his mad grandfather had brought from africa , and who made the family name as celebrated in ethnology as in exploration . in 1815 sir robert married a daughter of the seventh viscount brightholme and was subsequently blessed with three children , the eldest and youngest of whom were never publicly seen on account of deformities in mind and body . saddened by these family misfortunes , the scientist sought relief in work , and made two long expeditions in the interior of africa . in 1849 his second son , nevil , a singularly repellent person who seemed to combine the surliness of philip jermyn with the hauteur of the brightholmes , ran away with a vulgar dancer , but was pardoned upon his return in the following year . he came back to jermyn house a widower with an infant son , alfred , who was one day to be the father of arthur jermyn .\\n\\nfriends said that it was this series of griefs which unhinged the mind of sir robert jermyn , yet it was probably merely a bit of african folklore which caused the disaster . the elderly scholar had been collecting legends of the onga tribes near the field of his grandfather\\'s and his own explorations , hoping in some way to account for sir wade\\'s wild tales of a lost city peopled by strange hybrid creatures . a certain consistency in the strange papers of his ancestor suggested that the madman\\'s imagination might have been stimulated by native myths . on october 19 , 1852 , the explorer samuel seaton called at jermyn house with a manuscript of notes collected among the ongas , believing that certain legends of a gray city of white apes ruled by a white god might prove valuable to the ethnologist . in his conversation he probably supplied many additional details ; the nature of which will never be known , since a hideous series of tragedies suddenly burst into being . when sir robert jermyn emerged from his library he left behind the strangled corpse of the explorer , and before he could be restrained , had put an end to all three of his children ; the two who were never seen , and the son who had run away . nevil jermyn died in the successful defence of his own two-year-old son , who had apparently been included in the old man\\'s madly murderous scheme . sir robert himself , after repeated attempts at suicide and a stubborn refusal to utter an articulate sound , died of apoplexy in the second year of his confinement .\\n\\nsir alfred jermyn was a baronet before his fourth birthday , but his tastes never matched his title . at twenty he had joined a band of music-hall performers , and at thirty-six had deserted his wife and child to travel with an itinerant american circus . his end was very revolting . among the animals in the exhibition with which he travelled was a huge bull gorilla of lighter colour than the average ; a surprisingly tractable beast of much popularity with the performers . with this gorilla alfred jermyn was singularly fascinated , and on many occasions the two would eye each other for long periods through the intervening bars . eventually jermyn asked and obtained permission to train the animal , astonishing audiences and fellow performers alike with his success . one morning in chicago , as the gorilla and alfred jermyn were rehearsing an exceedingly clever boxing match , the former delivered a blow of more than the usual force , hurting both the body and the dignity of the amateur trainer . of what followed , members of \"the greatest show on earth\" do not like to speak . they did not expect to hear sir alfred jermyn emit a shrill , inhuman scream , or to see him seize his clumsy antagonist with both hands , dash it to the floor of the cage , and bite fiendishly at its hairy throat . the gorilla was off its guard , but not for long , and before anything could be done by the regular trainer , the body which had belonged to a baronet was past recognition .\\n\\nii\\n\\narthur jermyn was the son of sir alfred jermyn and a music-hall singer of unknown origin . when the husband and father deserted his family , the mother took the child to jermyn house ; where there was none left to object to her presence . she was not without notions of what a nobleman\\'s dignity should be , and saw to it that her son received the best education which limited money could provide . the family resources were now sadly slender , and jermyn house had fallen into woeful disrepair , but young arthur loved the old edifice and all its contents . he was not like any other jermyn who had ever lived , for he was a poet and a dreamer . some of the neighbouring families who had heard tales of old sir wade jermyn\\'s unseen portuguese wife declared that her latin blood must be showing itself ; but most persons merely sneered at his sensitiveness to beauty , attributing it to his music--hall mother , who was socially unrecognised . the poetic delicacy of arthur jermyn was the more remarkable because of his uncouth personal appearance . most of the jermyns had possessed a subtly odd and repellent cast , but arthur\\'s case was very striking . it is hard to say just what he resembled , but his expression , his facial angle , and the length of his arms gave a thrill of repulsion to those who met him for the first time .\\n\\nit was the mind and character of arthur jermyn which atoned for his aspect . gifted and learned , he took highest honours at oxford and seemed likely to redeem the intellectual fame of his family . though of poetic rather than scientific temperament , he planned to continue the work of his forefathers in african ethnology and antiquities , utilising the truly wonderful though strange collection of sir wade . with his fanciful mind he thought often of the prehistoric civilisation in which the mad explorer had so implicitly believed , and would weave tale after tale about the silent jungle city mentioned in the latter\\'s wilder notes and paragraphs . for the nebulous utterances concerning a nameless , unsuspected race of jungle hybrids he had a peculiar feeling of mingled terror and attraction , speculating on the possible basis of such a fancy , and seeking to obtain light among the more recent data gleaned by his great-grandfather and samuel seaton amongst the ongas .\\n\\nin 1911 , after the death of his mother , sir arthur jermyn determined to pursue his investigations to the utmost extent . selling a portion of his estate to obtain the requisite money , he outfitted an expedition and sailed for the congo . arranging with the belgian authorities for a party of guides , he spent a year in the onga and kahn country , finding data beyond the highest of his expectations . among the kaliris was an aged chief called mwanu , who possessed not only a highly retentive memory , but a singular degree of intelligence and interest in old legends . this ancient confirmed every tale which jermyn had heard , adding his own account of the stone city and the white apes as it had been told to him .\\n\\naccording to mwanu , the gray city and the hybrid creatures were no more , having been annihilated by the warlike n\\'bangus many years ago . this tribe , after destroying most of the edifices and killing the live beings , had carried off the stuffed goddess which had been the object of their quest ; the white ape-goddess which the strange beings worshipped , and which was held by congo tradition to be the form of one who had reigned as a princess among these beings . just what the white apelike creatures could have been , mwanu had no idea , but he thought they were the builders of the ruined city . jermyn could form no conjecture , but by close questioning obtained a very picturesque legend of the stuffed goddess .\\n\\nthe ape-princess , it was said , became the consort of a great white god who had come out of the west . for a long time they had reigned over the city together , but when they had a son , all three went away . later the god and princess had returned , and upon the death of the princess her divine husband had mummified the body and enshrined it in a vast house of stone , where it was worshipped . then he departed alone . the legend here seemed to present three variants . according to one story , nothing further happened save that the stuffed goddess became a symbol of supremacy for whatever tribe might possess it . it was for this reason that the n\\'bangus carried it off . a second story told of a god\\'s return and death at the feet of his enshrined wife . a third told of the return of the son , grown to manhood--or apehood or godhood , as the case might be--yet unconscious of his identity . surely the imaginative blacks had made the most of whatever events might lie behind the extravagant legendry .\\n\\nof the reality of the jungle city described by old sir wade , arthur jermyn had no further doubt ; and was hardly astonished when early in 1912 he came upon what was left of it . its size must have been exaggerated , yet the stones lying about proved that it was no mere negro village . unfortunately no carvings could be found , and the small size of the expedition prevented operations toward clearing the one visible passageway that seemed to lead down into the system of vaults which sir wade had mentioned . the white apes and the stuffed goddess were discussed with all the native chiefs of the region , but it remained for a european to improve on the data offered by old mwanu . m . verhaeren , belgian agent at a trading-post on the congo , believed that he could not only locate but obtain the stuffed goddess , of which he had vaguely heard ; since the once mighty n\\'bangus were now the submissive servants of king albert\\'s government , and with but little persuasion could be induced to part with the gruesome deity they had carried off . when jermyn sailed for england , therefore , it was with the exultant probability that he would within a few months receive a priceless ethnological relic confirming the wildest of his great--great-great-grandfather\\'s narratives--that is , the wildest which he had ever heard . countrymen near jermyn house had perhaps heard wilder tales handed down from ancestors who had listened to sir wade around the tables of the knight\\'s head .\\n\\narthur jermyn waited very patiently for the expected box from m . verhaeren , meanwhile studying with increased diligence the manuscripts left by his mad ancestor . he began to feel closely akin to sir wade , and to seek relics of the latter\\'s personal life in england as well as of his african exploits . oral accounts of the mysterious and secluded wife had been numerous , but no tangible relic of her stay at jermyn house remained . jermyn wondered what circumstance had prompted or permitted such an effacement , and decided that the husband\\'s insanity was the prime cause . his great-great-great-grandmother , he recalled , was said to have been the daughter of a portuguese trader in africa . no doubt her practical heritage and superficial knowledge of the dark continent had caused her to flout sir wade\\'s tales of the interior , a thing which such a man would not be likely to forgive . she had died in africa , perhaps dragged thither by a husband determined to prove what he had told . but as jermyn indulged in these reflections he could not but smile at their futility , a century and a half after the death of both his strange progenitors .\\n\\nin june , 1913 , a letter arrived from m . verhaeren , telling of the finding of the stuffed goddess . it was , the belgian averred , a most extraordinary object ; an object quite beyond the power of a layman to classify . whether it was human or simian only a scientist could determine , and the process of determination would be greatly hampered by its imperfect condition . time and the congo climate are not kind to mummies ; especially when their preparation is as amateurish as seemed to be the case here . around the creature\\'s neck had been found a golden chain bearing an empty locket on which were armorial designs ; no doubt some hapless traveller\\'s keepsake , taken by the n\\'bangus and hung upon the goddess as a charm . in commenting on the contour of the mummy\\'s face , m . verhaeren suggested a whimsical comparison ; or rather , expressed a humorous wonder just how it would strike his corespondent , but was too much interested scientifically to waste many words in levity . the stuffed goddess , he wrote , would arrive duly packed about a month after receipt of the letter .\\n\\nthe boxed object was delivered at jermyn house on the afternoon of august 3 , 1913 , being conveyed immediately to the large chamber which housed the collection of african specimens as arranged by sir robert and arthur . what ensued can best be gathered from the tales of servants and from things and papers later examined . of the various tales , that of aged soames , the family butler , is most ample and coherent . according to this trustworthy man , sir arthur jermyn dismissed everyone from the room before opening the box , though the instant sound of hammer and chisel showed that he did not delay the operation . nothing was heard for some time ; just how long soames cannot exactly estimate , but it was certainly less than a quarter of an hour later that the horrible scream , undoubtedly in jermyn\\'s voice , was heard . immediately afterward jermyn emerged from the room , rushing frantically toward the front of the house as if pursued by some hideous enemy . the expression on his face , a face ghastly enough in repose , was beyond description . when near the front door he seemed to think of something , and turned back in his flight , finally disappearing down the stairs to the cellar . the servants were utterly dumbfounded , and watched at the head of the stairs , but their master did not return . a smell of oil was all that came up from the regions below . after dark a rattling was heard at the door leading from the cellar into the courtyard ; and a stable-boy saw arthur jermyn , glistening from head to foot with oil and redolent of that fluid , steal furtively out and vanish on the black moor surrounding the house . then , in an exaltation of supreme horror , everyone saw the end . a spark appeared on the moor , a flame arose , and a pillar of human fire reached to the heavens . the house of jermyn no longer existed .\\n\\nthe reason why arthur jermyn\\'s charred fragments were not collected and buried lies in what was found afterward , principally the thing in the box . the stuffed goddess was a nauseous sight , withered and eaten away , but it was clearly a mummified white ape of some unknown species , less hairy than any recorded variety , and infinitely nearer mankind--quite shockingly so . detailed description would be rather unpleasant , but two salient particulars must be told , for they fit in revoltingly with certain notes of sir wade jermyn\\'s african expeditions and with the congolese legends of the white god and the ape-princess . the two particulars in question are these : the arms on the golden locket about the creature\\'s neck were the jermyn arms , and the jocose suggestion of m . verhaeren about certain resemblance as connected with the shrivelled face applied with vivid , ghastly , and unnatural horror to none other than the sensitive arthur jermyn , great-great-great-grandson of sir wade jermyn and an unknown wife . members of the royal anthropological institute burned the thing and threw the locket into a well , and some of them do not admit that arthur jermyn ever existed .\\n', shape=(), dtype=string)\n",

while the sparsely scattered houses wear a surprisingly uniform aspect of age , squalor , and dilapidation .\\n\\nwithout knowing why , one hesitates to ask directions from the gnarled solitary figures spied now and then on crumbling doorsteps or on the sloping , rock-strewn meadows . those figures are so silent and furtive that one feels somehow confronted by forbidden things , with which it would be better to have nothing to do . when a rise in the road brings the mountains in view above the deep woods , the feeling of strange uneasiness is increased . the summits are too rounded and symmetrical to give a sense of comfort and naturalness , and sometimes the sky silhouettes with especial clearness the queer circles of tall stone pillars with which most of them are crowned .\\n\\ngorges and ravines of problematical depth intersect the way , and the crude wooden bridges always seem of dubious safety . when the road dips again there are stretches of marshland that one instinctively dislikes , and indeed almost fears at evening when unseen whippoorwills chatter and the fireflies come out in abnormal profusion to dance to the raucous , creepily insistent rhythms of stridently piping bull-frogs . the thin , shining line of the miskatonic\\'s upper reaches has an oddly serpent-like suggestion as it winds close to the feet of the domed hills among which it rises .\\n\\nas the hills draw nearer , one heeds their wooded sides more than their stone-crowned tops . those sides loom up so darkly and precipitously that one wishes they would keep their distance , but there is no road by which to escape them . across a covered bridge one sees a small village huddled between the stream and the vertical slope of round mountain , and wonders at the cluster of rotting gambrel roofs bespeaking an earlier architectural period than that of the neighbouring region . it is not reassuring to see , on a closer glance , that most of the houses are deserted and falling to ruin , and that the broken-steepled church now harbours the one slovenly mercantile establishment of the hamlet . one dreads to trust the tenebrous tunnel of the bridge , yet there is no way to avoid it . once across , it is hard to prevent the impression of a faint , malign odour about the village street , as of the massed mould and decay of centuries . it is always a relief to get clear of the place , and to follow the narrow road around the base of the hills and across the level country beyond till it rejoins the aylesbury pike . afterwards one sometimes learns that one has been through dunwich .\\n\\noutsiders visit dunwich as seldom as possible , and since a certain season of horror all the signboards pointing towards it have been taken down . the scenery , judged by an ordinary aesthetic canon , is more than commonly beautiful ; yet there is no influx of artists or summer tourists . two centuries ago , when talk of witch-blood , satan-worship , and strange forest presences was not laughed at , it was the custom to give reasons for avoiding the locality . in our sensible age--since the dunwich horror of 1928 was hushed up by those who had the town\\'s and the world\\'s welfare at heart--people shun it without knowing exactly why . perhaps one reason--though it cannot apply to uninformed strangers--is that the natives are now repellently decadent , having gone far along that path of retrogression so common in many new england backwaters . they have come to form a race by themselves , with the well-defined mental and physical stigmata of degeneracy and inbreeding . the average of their intelligence is woefully low , whilst their annals reek of overt viciousness and of half-hidden murders , incests , and deeds of almost unnameable violence and perversity . the old gentry , representing the two or three armigerous families which came from salem in 1692 , have kept somewhat above the general level of decay ; though many branches are sunk into the sordid populace so deeply that only their names remain as a key to the origin they disgrace . some of the whateleys and bishops still send their eldest sons to harvard and miskatonic , though those sons seldom return to the mouldering gambrel roofs under which they and their ancestors were born .\\n\\nno one , even those who have the facts concerning the recent horror , can say just what is the matter with dunwich ; though old legends speak of unhallowed rites and conclaves of the indians , amidst which they called forbidden shapes of shadow out of the great rounded hills , and made wild orgiastic prayers that were answered by loud crackings and rumblings from the ground below . in 1747 the reverend abijah hoadley , newly come to the congregational church at dunwich village , preached a memorable sermon on the close presence of satan and his imps ; in which he said :\\n\\n\"it must be allow\\'d , that these blasphemies of an infernall train of daemons are matters of too common knowledge to be deny\\'d ; the cursed voices of azazel and buzrael , of beelzebub and belial , being heard now from under ground by above a score of credible witnesses now living . i myself did not more than a fortnight ago catch a very plain discourse of evill powers in the hill behind my house ; wherein there were a rattling and rolling , groaning , screeching , and hissing , such as no things of this earth could raise up , and which must needs have come from those caves that only black magick can discover , and only the divell unlock\" .\\n\\nmr . hoadley disappeared soon after delivering this sermon , but the text , printed in springfield , is still extant . noises in the hills continued to be reported from year to year , and still form a puzzle to geologists and physiographers .\\n\\nother traditions tell of foul odours near the hill-crowning circles of stone pillars , and of rushing airy presences to be heard faintly at certain hours from stated points at the bottom of the great ravines ; while still others try to explain the devil\\'s hop yard--a bleak , blasted hillside where no tree , shrub , or grass-blade will grow . then , too , the natives are mortally afraid of the numerous whippoorwills which grow vocal on warm nights . it is vowed that the birds are psychopomps lying in wait for the souls of the dying , and that they time their eerie cries in unison with the sufferer\\'s struggling breath . if they can catch the fleeing soul when it leaves the body , they instantly flutter away chittering in daemoniac laughter ; but if they fail , they subside gradually into a disappointed silence .\\n\\nthese tales , of course , are obsolete and ridiculous ; because they come down from very old times . dunwich is indeed ridiculously old--older by far than any of the communities within thirty miles of it . south of the village one may still spy the cellar walls and chimney of the ancient bishop house , which was built before 1700 ; whilst the ruins of the mill at the falls , built in 1806 , form the most modern piece of architecture to be seen . industry did not flourish here , and the nineteenth-century factory movement proved short-lived . oldest of all are the great rings of rough-hewn stone columns on the hilltops , but these are more generally attributed to the indians than to the settlers . deposits of skulls and bones , found within these circles and around the sizeable table-like rock on sentinel hill , sustain the popular belief that such spots were once the burial-places of the pocumtucks ; even though many ethnologists , disregarding the absurd improbability of such a theory , persist in believing the remains caucasian .\\n\\nii .\\n\\nit was in the township of dunwich , in a large and partly inhabited farmhouse set against a hillside four miles from the village and a mile and a half from any other dwelling , that wilbur whateley was born at 5 a .m . on sunday , the second of february , 1913 . this date was recalled because it was candlemas , which people in dunwich curiously observe under another name ; and because the noises in the hills had sounded , and all the dogs of the countryside had barked persistently , throughout the night before . less worthy of notice was the fact that the mother was one of the decadent whateleys , a somewhat deformed , unattractive albino woman of thirty-five , living with an aged and half-insane father about whom the most frightful tales of wizardry had been whispered in his youth . lavinia whateley had no known husband , but according to the custom of the region made no attempt to disavow the child ; concerning the other side of whose ancestry the country folk might--and did--speculate as widely as they chose . on the contrary , she seemed strangely proud of the dark , goatish-looking infant who formed such a contrast to her own sickly and pink-eyed albinism , and was heard to mutter many curious prophecies about its unusual powers and tremendous future .\\n\\nlavinia was one who would be apt to mutter such things , for she was a lone creature given to wandering amidst thunderstorms in the hills and trying to read the great odorous books which her father had inherited through two centuries of whateleys , and which were fast falling to pieces with age and wormholes . she had never been to school , but was filled with disjointed scraps of ancient lore that old whateley had taught her . the remote farmhouse had always been feared because of old whateley\\'s reputation for black magic , and the unexplained death by violence of mrs whateley when lavinia was twelve years old had not helped to make the place popular . isolated among strange influences , lavinia was fond of wild and grandiose day-dreams and singular occupations ; nor was her leisure much taken up by household cares in a home from which all standards of order and cleanliness had long since disappeared .\\n\\nthere was a hideous screaming which echoed above even the hill noises and the dogs\\' barking on the night wilbur was born , but no known doctor or midwife presided at his coming . neighbours knew nothing of him till a week afterward , when old whateley drove his sleigh through the snow into dunwich village and discoursed incoherently to the group of loungers at osborne\\'s general store . there seemed to be a change in the old man--an added element of furtiveness in the clouded brain which subtly transformed him from an object to a subject of fear--though he was not one to be perturbed by any common family event . amidst it all he showed some trace of the pride later noticed in his daughter , and what he said of the child\\'s paternity was remembered by many of his hearers years afterward .\\n\\n\\'i dun\\'t keer what folks think--ef lavinny\\'s boy looked like his pa , he wouldn\\'t look like nothin\\' ye expeck . ye needn\\'t think the only folks is the folks hereabouts . lavinny\\'s read some , an\\' has seed some things the most o\\' ye only tell abaout . i calc\\'late her man is as good a husban\\' as ye kin find this side of aylesbury ; an\\' ef ye knowed as much abaout the hills as i dew , ye wouldn\\'t ast no better church weddin\\' nor her\\'n . let me tell ye suthin--some day yew folks\\'ll hear a child o\\' lavinny\\'s a-callin\\' its father\\'s name on the top o\\' sentinel hill !\\'\\n\\nthe only person who saw wilbur during the first month of his life were old zechariah whateley , of the undecayed whateleys , and earl sawyer\\'s common-law wife , mamie bishop . mamie\\'s visit was frankly one of curiosity , and her subsequent tales did justice to her observations ; but zechariah came to lead a pair of alderney cows which old whateley had bought of his son curtis . this marked the beginning of a course of cattle-buying on the part of small wilbur\\'s family which ended only in 1928 , when the dunwich horror came and went ; yet at no time did the ramshackle whateley barn seem overcrowded with livestock . there came a period when people were curious enough to steal up and count the herd that grazed precariously on the steep hillside above the old farm-house , and they could never find more than ten or twelve anaemic , bloodless-looking specimens . evidently some blight or distemper , perhaps sprung from the unwholesome pasturage or the diseased fungi and timbers of the filthy barn , caused a heavy mortality amongst the whateley animals . odd wounds or sores , having something of the aspect of incisions , seemed to afflict the visible cattle ; and once or twice during the earlier months certain callers fancied they could discern similar sores about the throats of the grey , unshaven old man and his slattemly , crinkly-haired albino daughter .\\n\\nin the spring after wilbur\\'s birth lavinia resumed her customary rambles in the hills , bearing in her misproportioned arms the swarthy child . public interest in the whateleys subsided after most of the country folk had seen the baby , and no one bothered to comment on the swift development which that newcomer seemed every day to exhibit . wilbur\\'s growth was indeed phenomenal , for within three months of his birth he had attained a size and muscular power not usually found in infants under a full year of age . his motions and even his vocal sounds showed a restraint and deliberateness highly peculiar in an infant , and no one was really unprepared when , at seven months , he began to walk unassisted , with falterings which another month was sufficient to remove .\\n\\nit was somewhat after this time--on hallowe\\'en--that a great blaze was seen at midnight on the top of sentinel hill where the old table-like stone stands amidst its tumulus of ancient bones . considerable talk was started when silas bishop--of the undecayed bishops--mentioned having seen the boy running sturdily up that hill ahead of his mother about an hour before the blaze was remarked . silas was rounding up a stray heifer , but he nearly forgot his mission when he fleetingly spied the two figures in the dim light of his lantern . they darted almost noiselessly through the underbrush , and the astonished watcher seemed to think they were entirely unclothed . afterwards he could not be sure about the boy , who may have had some kind of a fringed belt and a pair of dark trunks or trousers on . wilbur was never subsequently seen alive and conscious without complete and tightly buttoned attire , the disarrangement or threatened disarrangement of which always seemed to fill him with anger and alarm . his contrast with his squalid mother and grandfather in this respect was thought very notable until the horror of 1928 suggested the most valid of reasons .\\n\\nthe next january gossips were mildly interested in the fact that \\'lavinny\\'s black brat\\' had commenced to talk , and at the age of only eleven months . his speech was somewhat remarkable both because of its difference from the ordinary accents of the region , and because it displayed a freedom from infantile lisping of which many children of three or four might well be proud . the boy was not talkative , yet when he spoke he seemed to reflect some elusive element wholly unpossessed by dunwich and its denizens . the strangeness did not reside in what he said , or even in the simple idioms he used ; but seemed vaguely linked with his intonation or with the internal organs that produced the spoken sounds . his facial aspect , too , was remarkable for its maturity ; for though he shared his mother\\'s and grandfather\\'s chinlessness , his firm and precociously shaped nose united with the expression of his large , dark , almost latin eyes to give him an air of quasi-adulthood and well-nigh preternatural intelligence . he was , however , exceedingly ugly despite his appearance of brilliancy ; there being something almost goatish or animalistic about his thick lips , large-pored , yellowish skin , coarse crinkly hair , and oddly elongated ears . he was soon disliked even more decidedly than his mother and grandsire , and all conjectures about him were spiced with references to the bygone magic of old whateley , and how the hills once shook when he shrieked the dreadful name of yog-sothoth in the midst of a circle of stones with a great book open in his arms before him . dogs abhorred the boy , and he was always obliged to take various defensive measures against their barking menace .\\n\\niii .\\n\\nmeanwhile old whateley continued to buy cattle without measurably increasing the size of his herd . he also cut timber and began to repair the unused parts of his house--a spacious , peak-roofed affair whose rear end was buried entirely in the rocky hillside , and whose three least-ruined ground-floor rooms had always been sufficient for himself and his daughter .\\n\\nthere must have been prodigious reserves of strength in the old man to enable him to accomplish so much hard labour ; and though he still babbled dementedly at times , his carpentry seemed to show the effects of sound calculation . it had already begun as soon as wilbur was born , when one of the many tool sheds had been put suddenly in order , clapboarded , and fitted with a stout fresh lock . now , in restoring the abandoned upper storey of the house , he was a no less thorough craftsman . his mania showed itself only in his tight boarding-up of all the windows in the reclaimed section--though many declared that it was a crazy thing to bother with the reclamation at all .\\n\\nless inexplicable was his fitting up of another downstairs room for his new grandson--a room which several callers saw , though no one was ever admitted to the closely-boarded upper storey . this chamber he lined with tall , firm shelving , along which he began gradually to arrange , in apparently careful order , all the rotting ancient books and parts of books which during his own day had been heaped promiscuously in odd corners of the various rooms .\\n\\n\\'i made some use of \\'em ,\\' he would say as he tried to mend a torn black-letter page with paste prepared on the rusty kitchen stove , \\'but the boy\\'s fitten to make better use of \\'em . he\\'d orter hev \\'em as well so as he kin , for they\\'re goin\\' to be all of his larnin\\' .\\'\\n\\nwhen wilbur was a year and seven months old--in september of 1914--his size and accomplishments were almost alarming . he had grown as large as a child of four , and was a fluent and incredibly intelligent talker . he ran freely about the fields and hills , and accompanied his mother on all her wanderings . at home he would pore diligently over the queer pictures and charts in his grandfather\\'s books , while old whateley would instruct and catechize him through long , hushed afternoons . by this time the restoration of the house was finished , and those who watched it wondered why one of the upper windows had been made into a solid plank door . it was a window in the rear of the east gable end , close against the hill ; and no one could imagine why a cleated wooden runway was built up to it from the ground . about the period of this work\\'s completion people noticed that the old tool-house , tightly locked and windowlessly clapboarded since wilbur\\'s birth , had been abandoned again . the door swung listlessly open , and when earl sawyer once stepped within after a cattle-selling call on old whateley he was quite discomposed by the singular odour he encountered--such a stench , he averred , as he had never before smelt in all his life except near the indian circles on the hills , and which could not come from anything sane or of this earth . but then , the homes and sheds of dunwich folk have never been remarkable for olfactory immaculateness .\\n\\nthe following months were void of visible events , save that everyone swore to a slow but steady increase in the mysterious hill noises . on may eve of 1915 there were tremors which even the aylesbury people felt , whilst the following hallowe\\'en produced an underground rumbling queerly synchronized with bursts of flame--\\'them witch whateleys\\' doin\\'s\\'--from the summit of sentinel hill . wilbur was growing up uncannily , so that he looked like a boy of ten as he entered his fourth year . he read avidly by himself now ; but talked much less than formerly . a settled taciturnity was absorbing him , and for the first time people began to speak specifically of the dawning look of evil in his goatish face . he would sometimes mutter an unfamiliar jargon , and chant in bizarre rhythms which chilled the listener with a sense of unexplainable terror . the aversion displayed towards him by dogs had now become a matter of wide remark , and he was obliged to carry a pistol in order to traverse the countryside in safety . his occasional use of the weapon did not enhance his popularity amongst the owners of canine guardians .\\n\\nthe few callers at the house would often find lavinia alone on the ground floor , while odd cries and footsteps resounded in the boarded-up second storey . she would never tell what her father and the boy were doing up there , though once she turned pale and displayed an abnormal degree of fear when a jocose fish-pedlar tried the locked door leading to the stairway . that pedlar told the store loungers at dunwich village that he thought he heard a horse stamping on that floor above . the loungers reflected , thinking of the door and runway , and of the cattle that so swiftly disappeared . then they shuddered as they recalled tales of old whateley\\'s youth , and of the strange things that are called out of the earth when a bullock is sacrificed at the proper time to certain heathen gods . it had for some time been noticed that dogs had begun to hate and fear the whole whateley place as violently as they hated and feared young wilbur personally .\\n\\nin 1917 the war came , and squire sawyer whateley , as chairman of the local draft board , had hard work finding a quota of young dunwich men fit even to be sent to development camp . the government , alarmed at such signs of wholesale regional decadence , sent several officers and medical experts to investigate ; conducting a survey which new england newspaper readers may still recall . it was the publicity attending this investigation which set reporters on the track of the whateleys , and caused the boston globe and arkham advertiser to print flamboyant sunday stories of young wilbur\\'s precociousness , old whateley\\'s black magic , and the shelves of strange books , the sealed second storey of the ancient farmhouse , and the weirdness of the whole region and its hill noises . wilbur was four and a half then , and looked like a lad of fifteen . his lips and cheeks were fuzzy with a coarse dark down , and his voice had begun to break .\\n\\nearl sawyer went out to the whateley place with both sets of reporters and camera men , and called their attention to the queer stench which now seemed to trickle down from the sealed upper spaces . it was , he said , exactly like a smell he had found in the toolshed abandoned when the house was finally repaired ; and like the faint odours which he sometimes thought he caught near the stone circle on the mountains . dunwich folk read the stories when they appeared , and grinned over the obvious mistakes . they wondered , too , why the writers made so much of the fact that old whateley always paid for his cattle in gold pieces of extremely ancient date . the whateleys had received their visitors with ill-concealed distaste , though they did not dare court further publicity by a violent resistance or refusal to talk .\\n\\niv .\\n\\nfor a decade the annals of the whateleys sink indistinguishably into the general life of a morbid community used to their queer ways and hardened to their may eve and all-hallows orgies . twice a year they would light fires on the top of sentinel hill , at which times the mountain rumblings would recur with greater and greater violence ; while at all seasons there were strange and portentous doings at the lonely farm-house . in the course of time callers professed to hear sounds in the sealed upper storey even when all the family were downstairs , and they wondered how swiftly or how lingeringly a cow or bullock was usually sacrificed . there was talk of a complaint to the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals but nothing ever came of it , since dunwich folk are never anxious to call the outside world\\'s attention to themselves .\\n\\nabout 1923 , when wilbur was a boy of ten whose mind , voice , stature , and bearded face gave all the impressions of maturity , a second great siege of carpentry went on at the old house . it was all inside the sealed upper part , and from bits of discarded lumber people concluded that the youth and his grandfather had knocked out all the partitions and even removed the attic floor , leaving only one vast open void between the ground storey and the peaked roof . they had torn down the great central chimney , too , and fitted the rusty range with a flimsy outside tin stove-pipe .\\n\\nin the spring after this event old whateley noticed the growing number of whippoorwills that would come out of cold spring glen to chirp under his window at night . he seemed to regard the circumstance as one of great significance , and told the loungers at osborn\\'s that he thought his time had almost come .\\n\\n\\'they whistle jest in tune with my breathin\\' naow ,\\' he said , \\'an\\' i guess they\\'re gittin\\' ready to ketch my soul . they know it\\'s a-goin\\' aout , an\\' dun\\'t calc\\'late to miss it . yew\\'ll know , boys , arter i\\'m gone , whether they git me er not . ef they dew , they\\'ll keep up a-singin\\' an\\' laffin\\' till break o\\' day . ef they dun\\'t they\\'ll kinder quiet daown like . i expeck them an\\' the souls they hunts fer hev some pretty tough tussles sometimes .\\'\\n\\non lammas night , 1924 , dr houghton of aylesbury was hastily summoned by wilbur whateley , who had lashed his one remaining horse through the darkness and telephoned from osborn\\'s in the village . he found old whateley in a very grave state , with a cardiac action and stertorous breathing that told of an end not far off . the shapeless albino daughter and oddly bearded grandson stood by the bedside , whilst from the vacant abyss overhead there came a disquieting suggestion of rhythmical surging or lapping , as of the waves on some level beach . the doctor , though , was chiefly disturbed by the chattering night birds outside ; a seemingly limitless legion of whippoorwills that cried their endless message in repetitions timed diabolically to the wheezing gasps of the dying man . it was uncanny and unnatural--too much , thought dr houghton , like the whole of the region he had entered so reluctantly in response to the urgent call .\\n\\ntowards one o\\'clock old whateley gained consciousness , and interrupted his wheezing to choke out a few words to his grandson .\\n\\n\\'more space , willy , more space soon . yew grows--an\\' that grows faster . it\\'ll be ready to serve ye soon , boy . open up the gates to yog-sothoth with the long chant that ye\\'ll find on page 751 of the complete edition , an\\' then put a match to the prison . fire from airth can\\'t burn it nohaow .\\'\\n\\nhe was obviously quite mad . after a pause , during which the flock of whippoorwills outside adjusted their cries to the altered tempo while some indications of the strange hill noises came from afar off , he added another sentence or two .\\n\\n\\'feed it reg\\'lar , willy , an\\' mind the quantity ; but dun\\'t let it grow too fast fer the place , fer ef it busts quarters or gits aout afore ye opens to yog-sothoth , it\\'s all over an\\' no use . only them from beyont kin make it multiply an\\' work . . .only them , the old uns as wants to come back . . .\\'\\n\\nbut speech gave place to gasps again , and lavinia screamed at the way the whippoorwills followed the change . it was the same for more than an hour , when the final throaty rattle came . dr houghton drew shrunken lids over the glazing grey eyes as the tumult of birds faded imperceptibly to silence . lavinia sobbed , but wilbur only chuckled whilst the hill noises rumbled faintly .\\n\\n\\'they didn\\'t git him ,\\' he muttered in his heavy bass voice .\\n\\nwilbur was by this time a scholar of really tremendous erudition in his one-sided way , and was quietly known by correspondence to many librarians in distant places where rare and forbidden books of old days are kept . he was more and more hated and dreaded around dunwich because of certain youthful disappearances which suspicion laid vaguely at his door ; but was always able to silence inquiry through fear or through use of that fund of old-time gold which still , as in his grandfather\\'s time , went forth regularly and increasingly for cattle-buying . he was now tremendously mature of aspect , and his height , having reached the normal adult limit , seemed inclined to wax beyond that figure . in 1925 , when a scholarly correspondent from miskatonic university called upon him one day and departed pale and puzzled , he was fully six and three-quarters feet tall .\\n\\nthrough all the years wilbur had treated his half-deformed albino mother with a growing contempt , finally forbidding her to go to the hills with him on may eve and hallowmass ; and in 1926 the poor creature complained to mamie bishop of being afraid of him .\\n\\n\\'they\\'s more abaout him as i knows than i kin tell ye , mamie ,\\' she said , \\'an\\' naowadays they\\'s more nor what i know myself . i vaow afur gawd , i dun\\'t know what he wants nor what he\\'s a-tryin\\' to dew .\\'\\n\\nthat hallowe\\'en the hill noises sounded louder than ever , and fire burned on sentinel hill as usual ; but people paid more attention to the rhythmical screaming of vast flocks of unnaturally belated whippoorwills which seemed to be assembled near the unlighted whateley farmhouse . after midnight their shrill notes burst into a kind of pandemoniac cachinnation which filled all the countryside , and not until dawn did they finally quiet down . then they vanished , hurrying southward where they were fully a month overdue . what this meant , no one could quite be certain till later . none of the countryfolk seemed to have died--but poor lavinia whateley , the twisted albino , was never seen again .\\n\\nin the summer of 1927 wilbur repaired two sheds in the farmyard and began moving his books and effects out to them . soon afterwards earl sawyer told the loungers at osborn\\'s that more carpentry was going on in the whateley farmhouse . wilbur was closing all the doors and windows on the ground floor , and seemed to be taking out partitions as he and his grandfather had done upstairs four years before . he was living in one of the sheds , and sawyer thought he seemed unusually worried and tremulous . people generally suspected him of knowing something about his mother\\'s disappearance , and very few ever approached his neighbourhood now . his height had increased to more than seven feet , and showed no signs of ceasing its development .\\n\\nv .\\n\\nthe following winter brought an event no less strange than wilbur\\'s first trip outside the dunwich region . correspondence with the widener library at harvard , the biblioth\\xc3\\xa8que nationale in paris , the british museum , the university of buenos ayres , and the library of miskatonic university at arkham had failed to get him the loan of a book he desperately wanted ; so at length he set out in person , shabby , dirty , bearded , and uncouth of dialect , to consult the copy at miskatonic , which was the nearest to him geographically . almost eight feet tall , and carrying a cheap new valise from osborne\\'s general store , this dark and goatish gargoyle appeared one day in arkham in quest of the dreaded volume kept under lock and key at the college library--the hideous necronomicon of the mad arab abdul alhazred in olaus wormius\\' latin version , as printed in spain in the seventeenth century . he had never seen a city before , but had no thought save to find his way to the university grounds ; where indeed , he passed heedlessly by the great white-fanged watchdog that barked with unnatural fury and enmity , and tugged frantically at its stout chain .\\n\\nwilbur had with him the priceless but imperfect copy of dr dee\\'s english version which his grandfather had bequeathed him , and upon receiving access to the latin copy he at once began to collate the two texts with the aim of discovering a certain passage which would have come on the 751st page of his own defective volume . this much he could not civilly refrain from telling the librarian--the same erudite henry armitage (a .m . miskatonic , ph .d . princeton , litt .d . johns hopkins) who had once called at the farm , and who now politely plied him with questions . he was looking , he had to admit , for a kind of formula or incantation containing the frightful name yog-sothoth , and it puzzled him to find discrepancies , duplications , and ambiguities which made the matter of determination far from easy . as he copied the formula he finally chose , dr armitage looked involuntarily over his shoulder at the open pages ; the left-hand one of which , in the latin version , contained such monstrous threats to the peace and sanity of the world .\\n\\nnor is it to be thought (ran the text as armitage mentally translated it) that man is either the oldest or the last of earth\\'s masters , or that the common bulk of life and substance walks alone . the old ones were , the old ones are , and the old ones shall be . not in the spaces we know , but between them , they walk serene and primal , undimensioned and to us unseen . yog-sothoth knows the gate . yog-sothoth is the gate . yog-sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate . past , present , future , all are one in yog-sothoth . he knows where the old ones broke through of old , and where they shall break through again . he knows where they had trod earth\\'s fields , and where they still tread them , and why no one can behold them as they tread . by their smell can men sometimes know them near , but of their semblance can no man know , saving only in the features of those they have begotten on mankind ; and of those are there many sorts , differing in likeness from man\\'s truest eidolon to that shape without sight or substance which is them . they walk unseen and foul in lonely places where the words have been spoken and the rites howled through at their seasons . the wind gibbers with their voices , and the earth mutters with their consciousness . they bend the forest and crush the city , yet may not forest or city behold the hand that smites . kadath in the cold waste hath known them , and what man knows kadath ? the ice desert of the south and the sunken isles of ocean hold stones whereon their seal is engraver , but who hath seen the deep frozen city or the sealed tower long garlanded with seaweed and barnacles ? great cthulhu is their cousin , yet can he spy them only dimly . i\\xc3\\xa4 ! shub-niggurath ! as a foulness shall ye know them . their hand is at your throats , yet ye see them not ; and their habitation is even one with your guarded threshold . yog-sothoth is the key to the gate , whereby the spheres meet . man rules now where they ruled once ; they shall soon rule where man rules now . after summer is winter , after winter summer . they wait patient and potent , for here shall they reign again .\\n\\ndr . armitage , associating what he was reading with what he had heard of dunwich and its brooding presences , and of wilbur whateley and his dim , hideous aura that stretched from a dubious birth to a cloud of probable matricide , felt a wave of fright as tangible as a draught of the tomb\\'s cold clamminess . the bent , goatish giant before him seemed like the spawn of another planet or dimension ; like something only partly of mankind , and linked to black gulfs of essence and entity that stretch like titan phantasms beyond all spheres of force and matter , space and time . presently wilbur raised his head and began speaking in that strange , resonant fashion which hinted at sound-producing organs unlike the run of mankind\\'s .\\n\\n\\'mr armitage ,\\' he said , \\'i calc\\'late i\\'ve got to take that book home . they\\'s things in it i\\'ve got to try under sarten conditions that i can\\'t git here , en\\' it \\'ud be a mortal sin to let a red-tape rule hold me up . let me take it along , sir , an\\' i\\'ll swar they wun\\'t nobody know the difference . i dun\\'t need to tell ye i\\'ll take good keer of it . it wan\\'t me that put this dee copy in the shape it is . . .\\'\\n\\nhe stopped as he saw firm denial on the librarian\\'s face , and his own goatish features grew crafty . armitage , half-ready to tell him he might make a copy of what parts he needed , thought suddenly of the possible consequences and checked himself . there was too much responsibility in giving such a being the key to such blasphemous outer spheres . whateley saw how things stood , and tried to answer lightly .\\n\\n\\'wal , all right , ef ye feel that way abaout it . maybe harvard won\\'t be so fussy as yew be .\\' and without saying more he rose and strode out of the building , stooping at each doorway .\\n\\narmitage heard the savage yelping of the great watchdog , and studied whateley\\'s gorilla-like lope as he crossed the bit of campus visible from the window . he thought of the wild tales he had heard , and recalled the old sunday stories in the advertiser ; these things , and the lore he had picked up from dunwich rustics and villagers during his one visit there . unseen things not of earth--or at least not of tridimensional earth--rushed foetid and horrible through new england\\'s glens , and brooded obscenely on the mountain tops . of this he had long felt certain . now he seemed to sense the close presence of some terrible part of the intruding horror , and to glimpse a hellish advance in the black dominion of the ancient and once passive nightmare . he locked away the necronomicon with a shudder of disgust , but the room still reeked with an unholy and unidentifiable stench . \\'as a foulness shall ye know them ,\\' he quoted . yes--the odour was the same as that which had sickened him at the whateley farmhouse less than three years before . he thought of wilbur , goatish and ominous , once again , and laughed mockingly at the village rumours of his parentage .\\n\\n\\'inbreeding ?\\' armitage muttered half-aloud to himself . \\'great god , what simpletons ! show them arthur machen\\'s great god pan and they\\'ll think it a common dunwich scandal ! but what thing--what cursed shapeless influence on or off this three-dimensional earth--was wilbur whateley\\'s father ? born on candlemas--nine months after may eve of 1912 , when the talk about the queer earth noises reached clear to arkham--what walked on the mountains that may night ? what roodmas horror fastened itself on the world in half-human flesh and blood ?\\'\\n\\nduring the ensuing weeks dr armitage set about to collect all possible data on wilbur whateley and the formless presences around dunwich . he got in communication with dr houghton of aylesbury , who had attended old whateley in his last illness , and found much to ponder over in the grandfather\\'s last words as quoted by the physician . a visit to dunwich village failed to bring out much that was new ; but a close survey of the necronomicon , in those parts which wilbur had sought so avidly , seemed to supply new and terrible clues to the nature , methods , and desires of the strange evil so vaguely threatening this planet . talks with several students of archaic lore in boston , and letters to many others elsewhere , gave him a growing amazement which passed slowly through varied degrees of alarm to a state of really acute spiritual fear . as the summer drew on he felt dimly that something ought to be done about the lurking terrors of the upper miskatonic valley , and about the monstrous being known to the human world as wilbur whateley .\\n\\nvi .\\n\\nthe dunwich horror itself came between lammas and the equinox in 1928 , and dr armitage was among those who witnessed its monstrous prologue . he had heard , meanwhile , of whateley\\'s grotesque trip to cambridge , and of his frantic efforts to borrow or copy from the necronomicon at the widener library . those efforts had been in vain , since armitage had issued warnings of the keenest intensity to all librarians having charge of the dreaded volume . wilbur had been shockingly nervous at cambridge ; anxious for the book , yet almost equally anxious to get home again , as if he feared the results of being away long .\\n\\nearly in august the half-expected outcome developed , and in the small hours of the third dr armitage was awakened suddenly by the wild , fierce cries of the savage watchdog on the college campus . deep and terrible , the snarling , half-mad growls and barks continued ; always in mounting volume , but with hideously significant pauses . then there rang out a scream from a wholly different throat--such a scream as roused half the sleepers of arkham and haunted their dreams ever afterwards--such a scream as could come from no being born of earth , or wholly of earth .\\n\\narmitage , hastening into some clothing and rushing across the street and lawn to the college buildings , saw that others were ahead of him ; and heard the echoes of a burglar-alarm still shrilling from the library . an open window showed black and gaping in the moonlight . what had come had indeed completed its entrance ; for the barking and the screaming , now fast fading into a mixed low growling and moaning , proceeded unmistakably from within . some instinct warned armitage that what was taking place was not a thing for unfortified eyes to see , so he brushed back the crowd with authority as he unlocked the vestibule door . among the others he saw professor warren rice and dr francis morgan , men to whom he had told some of his conjectures and misgivings ; and these two he motioned to accompany him inside . the inward sounds , except for a watchful , droning whine from the dog , had by this time quite subsided ; but armitage now perceived with a sudden start that a loud chorus of whippoorwills among the shrubbery had commenced a damnably rhythmical piping , as if in unison with the last breaths of a dying man .\\n\\nthe building was full of a frightful stench which dr armitage knew too well , and the three men rushed across the hall to the small genealogical reading-room whence the low whining came . for a second nobody dared to turn on the light , then armitage summoned up his courage and snapped the switch . one of the three--it is not certain which--shrieked aloud at what sprawled before them among disordered tables and overturned chairs . professor rice declares that he wholly lost consciousness for an instant , though he did not stumble or fall .\\n\\nthe thing that lay half-bent on its side in a foetid pool of greenish-yellow ichor and tarry stickiness was almost nine feet tall , and the dog had torn off all the clothing and some of the skin . it was not quite dead , but twitched silently and spasmodically while its chest heaved in monstrous unison with the mad piping of the expectant whippoorwills outside . bits of shoe-leather and fragments of apparel were scattered about the room , and just inside the window an empty canvas sack lay where it had evidently been thrown . near the central desk a revolver had fallen , a dented but undischarged cartridge later explaining why it had not been fired . the thing itself , however , crowded out all other images at the time . it would be trite and not wholly accurate to say that no human pen could describe it , but one may properly say that it could not be vividly visualized by anyone whose ideas of aspect and contour are too closely bound up with the common life-forms of this planet and of the three known dimensions . it was partly human , beyond a doubt , with very manlike hands and head , and the goatish , chinless face had the stamp of the whateley\\'s upon it . but the torso and lower parts of the body were teratologically fabulous , so that only generous clothing could ever have enabled it to walk on earth unchallenged or uneradicated .\\n\\nabove the waist it was semi-anthropomorphic ; though its chest , where the dog\\'s rending paws still rested watchfully , had the leathery , reticulated hide of a crocodile or alligator . the back was piebald with yellow and black , and dimly suggested the squamous covering of certain snakes . below the waist , though , it was the worst ; for here all human resemblance left off and sheer phantasy began . the skin was thickly covered with coarse black fur , and from the abdomen a score of long greenish-grey tentacles with red sucking mouths protruded limply .\\n\\ntheir arrangement was odd , and seemed to follow the symmetries of some cosmic geometry unknown to earth or the solar system . on each of the hips , deep set in a kind of pinkish , ciliated orbit , was what seemed to be a rudimentary eye ; whilst in lieu of a tail there depended a kind of trunk or feeler with purple annular markings , and with many evidences of being an undeveloped mouth or throat . the limbs , save for their black fur , roughly resembled the hind legs of prehistoric earth\\'s giant saurians , and terminated in ridgy-veined pads that were neither hooves nor claws . when the thing breathed , its tail and tentacles rhythmically changed colour , as if from some circulatory cause normal to the non-human greenish tinge , whilst in the tail it was manifest as a yellowish appearance which alternated with a sickly grayish-white in the spaces between the purple rings . of genuine blood there was none ; only the foetid greenish-yellow ichor which trickled along the painted floor beyond the radius of the stickiness , and left a curious discoloration behind it .\\n\\nas the presence of the three men seemed to rouse the dying thing , it began to mumble without turning or raising its head . dr armitage made no written record of its mouthings , but asserts confidently that nothing in english was uttered . at first the syllables defied all correlation with any speech of earth , but towards the last there came some disjointed fragments evidently taken from the necronomicon , that monstrous blasphemy in quest of which the thing had perished . these fragments , as armitage recalls them , ran something like \\'n\\'gai , n\\'gha\\'ghaa , bugg-shoggog , y\\'hah : yog-sothoth , yog-sothoth . . .\\' they trailed off into nothingness as the whippoorwills shrieked in rhythmical crescendos of unholy anticipation .\\n\\nthen came a halt in the gasping , and the dog raised its head in a long , lugubrious howl . a change came over the yellow , goatish face of the prostrate thing , and the great black eyes fell in appallingly . outside the window the shrilling of the whippoorwills had suddenly ceased , and above the murmurs of the gathering crowd there came the sound of a panic-struck whirring and fluttering . against the moon vast clouds of feathery watchers rose and raced from sight , frantic at that which they had sought for prey .\\n\\nall at once the dog started up abruptly , gave a frightened bark , and leaped nervously out of the window by which it had entered . a cry rose from the crowd , and dr armitage shouted to the men outside that no one must be admitted till the police or medical examiner came . he was thankful that the windows were just too high to permit of peering in , and drew the dark curtains carefully down over each one . by this time two policemen had arrived ; and dr morgan , meeting them in the vestibule , was urging them for their own sakes to postpone entrance to the stench-filled reading-room till the examiner came and the prostrate thing could be covered up .\\n\\nmeanwhile frightful changes were taking place on the floor . one need not describe the kind and rate of shrinkage and disintegration that occurred before the eyes of dr armitage and professor rice ; but it is permissible to say that , aside from the external appearance of face and hands , the really human element in wilbur whateley must have been very small . when the medical examiner came , there was only a sticky whitish mass on the painted boards , and the monstrous odour had nearly disappeared . apparently whateley had had no skull or bony skeleton ; at least , in any true or stable sense . he had taken somewhat after his unknown father .\\n\\nvii .\\n\\nyet all this was only the prologue of the actual dunwich horror . formalities were gone through by bewildered officials , abnormal details were duly kept from press and public , and men were sent to dunwich and aylesbury to look up property and notify any who might be heirs of the late wilbur whateley . they found the countryside in great agitation , both because of the growing rumblings beneath the domed hills , and because of the unwonted stench and the surging , lapping sounds which came increasingly from the great empty shell formed by whateley\\'s boarded-up farmhouse . earl sawyer , who tended the horse and cattle during wilbur\\'s absence , had developed a woefully acute case of nerves . the officials devised excuses not to enter the noisome boarded place ; and were glad to confine their survey of the deceased\\'s living quarters , the newly mended sheds , to a single visit . they filed a ponderous report at the courthouse in aylesbury , and litigations concerning heirship are said to be still in progress amongst the innumerable whateleys , decayed and undecayed , of the upper miskatonic valley .\\n\\nan almost interminable manuscript in strange characters , written in a huge ledger and adjudged a sort of diary because of the spacing and the variations in ink and penmanship , presented a baffling puzzle to those who found it on the old bureau which served as its owner\\'s desk . after a week of debate it was sent to miskatonic university , together with the deceased\\'s collection of strange books , for study and possible translation ; but even the best linguists soon saw that it was not likely to be unriddled with ease . no trace of the ancient gold with which wilbur and old whateley had always paid their debts has yet been discovered .\\n\\nit was in the dark of september ninth that the horror broke loose . the hill noises had been very pronounced during the evening , and dogs barked frantically all night . early risers on the tenth noticed a peculiar stench in the air . about seven o\\'clock luther brown , the hired boy at george corey\\'s , between cold spring glen and the village , rushed frenziedly back from his morning trip to ten-acre meadow with the cows . he was almost convulsed with fright as he stumbled into the kitchen ; and in the yard outside the no less frightened herd were pawing and lowing pitifully , having followed the boy back in the panic they shared with him . between gasps luther tried to stammer out his tale to mrs corey .\\n\\n\\'up thar in the rud beyont the glen , mis\\' corey--they\\'s suthin\\' ben thar ! it smells like thunder , an\\' all the bushes an\\' little trees is pushed back from the rud like they\\'d a haouse ben moved along of it . an\\' that ain\\'t the wust , nuther . they\\'s prints in the rud , mis\\' corey--great raound prints as big as barrel-heads , all sunk dawon deep like a elephant had ben along , only they\\'s a sight more nor four feet could make ! i looked at one or two afore i run , an\\' i see every one was covered with lines spreadin\\' aout from one place , like as if big palm-leaf fans--twict or three times as big as any they is--hed of ben paounded dawon into the rud . an\\' the smell was awful , like what it is around wizard whateley\\'s ol\\' haouse . . .\\'\\n\\nhere he faltered , and seemed to shiver afresh with the fright that had sent him flying home . mrs corey , unable to extract more information , began telephoning the neighbours ; thus starting on its rounds the overture of panic that heralded the major terrors . when she got sally sawyer , housekeeper at seth bishop\\'s , the nearest place to whateley\\'s , it became her turn to listen instead of transmit ; for sally\\'s boy chauncey , who slept poorly , had been up on the hill towards whateley\\'s , and had dashed back in terror after one look at the place , and at the pasturage where mr bishop\\'s cows had been left out all night .\\n\\n\\'yes , mis\\' corey ,\\' came sally\\'s tremulous voice over the party wire , \\'cha\\'ncey he just come back a-postin\\' , and couldn\\'t half talk fer bein\\' scairt ! he says ol\\' whateley\\'s house is all bowed up , with timbers scattered raound like they\\'d ben dynamite inside ; only the bottom floor ain\\'t through , but is all covered with a kind o\\' tar-like stuff that smells awful an\\' drips daown offen the aidges onto the graoun\\' whar the side timbers is blowed away . an\\' they\\'s awful kinder marks in the yard , tew--great raound marks bigger raound than a hogshead , an\\' all sticky with stuff like is on the browed-up haouse . cha\\'ncey he says they leads off into the medders , whar a great swath wider\\'n a barn is matted daown , an\\' all the stun walls tumbled every whichway wherever it goes .\\n\\n\\'an\\' he says , says he , mis\\' corey , as haow he sot to look fer seth\\'s caows , frightened ez he was an\\' faound \\'em in the upper pasture nigh the devil\\'s hop yard in an awful shape . haff on \\'em\\'s clean gone , an\\' nigh haff o\\' them that\\'s left is sucked most dry o\\' blood , with sores on \\'em like they\\'s ben on whateleys cattle ever senct lavinny\\'s black brat was born . seth hes gone aout naow to look at \\'em , though i\\'ll vaow he won\\'t keer ter git very nigh wizard whateley\\'s ! cha\\'ncey didn\\'t look keerful ter see whar the big matted-daown swath led arter it leff the pasturage , but he says he thinks it p\\'inted towards the glen rud to the village .\\n\\n\\'i tell ye , mis\\' corey , they\\'s suthin\\' abroad as hadn\\'t orter be abroad , an\\' i for one think that black wilbur whateley , as come to the bad end he deserved , is at the bottom of the breedin\\' of it . he wa\\'n\\'t all human hisself , i allus says to everybody ; an\\' i think he an\\' ol\\' whateley must a raised suthin\\' in that there nailed-up haouse as ain\\'t even so human as he was . they\\'s allus ben unseen things araound dunwich--livin\\' things--as ain\\'t human an\\' ain\\'t good fer human folks .\\n\\n\\'the graoun\\' was a-talkin\\' las\\' night , an\\' towards mornin\\' cha\\'ncey he heered the whippoorwills so laoud in col\\' spring glen he couldn\\'t sleep nun . then he thought he heered another faint-like saound over towards wizard whateley\\'s--a kinder rippin\\' or tearin\\' o\\' wood , like some big box er crate was bein\\' opened fur off . what with this an\\' that , he didn\\'t git to sleep at all till sunup , an\\' no sooner was he up this mornin\\' , but he\\'s got to go over to whateley\\'s an\\' see what\\'s the matter . he see enough i tell ye , mis\\' corey ! this dun\\'t mean no good , an\\' i think as all the men-folks ought to git up a party an\\' do suthin\\' . i know suthin\\' awful\\'s abaout , an\\' feel my time is nigh , though only gawd knows jest what it is .\\n\\n\\'did your luther take accaount o\\' whar them big tracks led tew ? no ? wal , mis\\' corey , ef they was on the glen rud this side o\\' the glen , an\\' ain\\'t got to your haouse yet , i calc\\'late they must go into the glen itself . they would do that . i allus says col\\' spring glen ain\\'t no healthy nor decent place . the whippoorwills an\\' fireflies there never did act like they was creaters o\\' gawd , an\\' they\\'s them as says ye kin hear strange things a-rushin\\' an\\' a-talkin\\' in the air dawon thar ef ye stand in the right place , atween the rock falls an\\' bear\\'s den .\\'\\n\\nby that noon fully three-quarters of the men and boys of dunwich were trooping over the roads and meadows between the newmade whateley ruins and cold spring glen , examining in horror the vast , monstrous prints , the maimed bishop cattle , the strange , noisome wreck of the farmhouse , and the bruised , matted vegetation of the fields and roadside . whatever had burst loose upon the world had assuredly gone down into the great sinister ravine ; for all the trees on the banks were bent and broken , and a great avenue had been gouged in the precipice-hanging underbrush . it was as though a house , launched by an avalanche , had slid down through the tangled growths of the almost vertical slope . from below no sound came , but only a distant , undefinable foetor ; and it is not to be wondered at that the men preferred to stay on the edge and argue , rather than descend and beard the unknown cyclopean horror in its lair . three dogs that were with the party had barked furiously at first , but seemed cowed and reluctant when near the glen . someone telephoned the news to the aylesbury transcript ; but the editor , accustomed to wild tales from dunwich , did no more than concoct a humorous paragraph about it ; an item soon afterwards reproduced by the associated press .\\n\\nthat night everyone went home , and every house and barn was barricaded as stoutly as possible . needless to say , no cattle were allowed to remain in open pasturage . about two in the morning a frightful stench and the savage barking of the dogs awakened the household at elmer frye\\'s , on the eastern edge of cold spring glen , and all agreed that they could hear a sort of muffled swishing or lapping sound from somewhere outside . mrs frye proposed telephoning the neighbours , and elmer was about to agree when the noise of splintering wood burst in upon their deliberations . it came , apparently , from the barn ; and was quickly followed by a hideous screaming and stamping amongst the cattle . the dogs slavered and crouched close to the feet of the fear-numbed family . frye lit a lantern through force of habit , but knew it would be death to go out into that black farmyard . the children and the women-folk whimpered , kept from screaming by some obscure , vestigial instinct of defence which told them their lives depended on silence . at last the noise of the cattle subsided to a pitiful moaning , and a great snapping , crashing , and crackling ensued . the fryes , huddled together in the sitting-room , did not dare to move until the last echoes died away far down in cold spring glen . then , amidst the dismal moans from the stable and the daemoniac piping of the late whippoorwills in the glen , selina frye tottered to the telephone and spread what news she could of the second phase of the horror .\\n\\nthe next day all the countryside was in a panic ; and cowed , uncommunicative groups came and went where the fiendish thing had occurred . two titan swaths of destruction stretched from the glen to the frye farmyard , monstrous prints covered the bare patches of ground , and one side of the old red barn had completely caved in . of the cattle , only a quarter could be found and identified . some of these were in curious fragments , and all that survived had to be shot . earl sawyer suggested that help be asked from aylesbury or arkham , but others maintained it would be of no use . old zebulon whateley , of a branch that hovered about halfway between soundness and decadence , made darkly wild suggestions about rites that ought to be practiced on the hill-tops . he came of a line where tradition ran strong , and his memories of chantings in the great stone circles were not altogether connected with wilbur and his grandfather .\\n\\ndarkness fell upon a stricken countryside too passive to organize for real defence . in a few cases closely related families would band together and watch in the gloom under one roof ; but in general there was only a repetition of the barricading of the night before , and a futile , ineffective gesture of loading muskets and setting pitchforks handily about . nothing , however , occurred except some hill noises ; and when the day came there were many who hoped that the new horror had gone as swiftly as it had come . there were even bold souls who proposed an offensive expedition down in the glen , though they did not venture to set an actual example to the still reluctant majority .\\n\\nwhen night came again the barricading was repeated , though there was less huddling together of families . in the morning both the frye and the seth bishop households reported excitement among the dogs and vague sounds and stenches from afar , while early explorers noted with horror a fresh set of the monstrous tracks in the road skirting sentinel hill . as before , the sides of the road showed a bruising indicative of the blasphemously stupendous bulk of the horror ; whilst the conformation of the tracks seemed to argue a passage in two directions , as if the moving mountain had come from cold spring glen and returned to it along the same path . at the base of the hill a thirty-foot swath of crushed shrubbery saplings led steeply upwards , and the seekers gasped when they saw that even the most perpendicular places did not deflect the inexorable trail . whatever the horror was , it could scale a sheer stony cliff of almost complete verticality ; and as the investigators climbed round to the hill\\'s summit by safer routes they saw that the trail ended--or rather , reversed--there .\\n\\nit was here that the whateleys used to build their hellish fires and chant their hellish rituals by the table-like stone on may eve and hallowmass . now that very stone formed the centre of a vast space thrashed around by the mountainous horror , whilst upon its slightly concave surface was a thick and foetid deposit of the same tarry stickiness observed on the floor of the ruined whateley farmhouse when the horror escaped . men looked at one another and muttered . then they looked down the hill . apparently the horror had descended by a route much the same as that of its ascent . to speculate was futile . reason , logic , and normal ideas of motivation stood confounded . only old zebulon , who was not with the group , could have done justice to the situation or suggested a plausible explanation .\\n\\nthursday night began much like the others , but it ended less happily . the whippoorwills in the glen had screamed with such unusual persistence that many could not sleep , and about 3 a .m . all the party telephones rang tremulously . those who took down their receivers heard a fright-mad voice shriek out , \\'help , oh , my gawd ! . . .\\' and some thought a crashing sound followed the breaking off of the exclamation . there was nothing more . no one dared do anything , and no one knew till morning whence the call came . then those who had heard it called everyone on the line , and found that only the fryes did not reply . the truth appeared an hour later , when a hastily assembled group of armed men trudged out to the frye place at the head of the glen . it was horrible , yet hardly a surprise . there were more swaths and monstrous prints , but there was no longer any house . it had caved in like an egg-shell , and amongst the ruins nothing living or dead could be discovered . only a stench and a tarry stickiness . the elmer fryes had been erased from dunwich .\\n\\nviii .\\n\\nin the meantime a quieter yet even more spiritually poignant phase of the horror had been blackly unwinding itself behind the closed door of a shelf-lined room in arkham . the curious manuscript record or diary of wilbur whateley , delivered to miskatonic university for translation had caused much worry and bafflement among the experts in language both ancient and modern ; its very alphabet , notwithstanding a general resemblance to the heavily-shaded arabic used in mesopotamia , being absolutely unknown to any available authority . the final conclusion of the linguists was that the text represented an artificial alphabet , giving the effect of a cipher ; though none of the usual methods of cryptographic solution seemed to furnish any clue , even when applied on the basis of every tongue the writer might conceivably have used . the ancient books taken from whateley\\'s quarters , while absorbingly interesting and in several cases promising to open up new and terrible lines of research among philosophers and men of science , were of no assistance whatever in this matter . one of them , a heavy tome with an iron clasp , was in another unknown alphabet--this one of a very different cast , and resembling sanskrit more than anything else . the old ledger was at length given wholly into the charge of dr armitage , both because of his peculiar interest in the whateley matter , and because of his wide linguistic learning and skill in the mystical formulae of antiquity and the middle ages .\\n\\narmitage had an idea that the alphabet might be something esoterically used by certain forbidden cults which have come down from old times , and which have inherited many forms and traditions from the wizards of the saracenic world . that question , however , he did not deem vital ; since it would be unnecessary to know the origin of the symbols if , as he suspected , they were used as a cipher in a modern language . it was his belief that , considering the great amount of text involved , the writer would scarcely have wished the trouble of using another speech than his own , save perhaps in certain special formulae and incantations . accordingly he attacked the manuscript with the preliminary assumption that the bulk of it was in english .\\n\\ndr armitage knew , from the repeated failures of his colleagues , that the riddle was a deep and complex one ; and that no simple mode of solution could merit even a trial . all through late august he fortified himself with the mass lore of cryptography ; drawing upon the fullest resources of his own library , and wading night after night amidst the arcana of trithemius\\' poligraphia , giambattista porta\\'s de furtivis literarum notis , de vigenere\\'s traite des chiffres , falconer\\'s cryptomenysis patefacta , davys\\' and thicknesse\\'s eighteenth-century treatises , and such fairly modern authorities as blair , van marten and kluber\\'s script itself , and in time became convinced that he had to deal with one of those subtlest and most ingenious of cryptograms , in which many separate lists of corresponding letters are arranged like the multiplication table , and the message built up with arbitrary key-words known only to the initiated . the older authorities seemed rather more helpful than the newer ones , and armitage concluded that the code of the manuscript was one of great antiquity , no doubt handed down through a long line of mystical experimenters . several times he seemed near daylight , only to be set back by some unforeseen obstacle . then , as september approached , the clouds began to clear . certain letters , as used in certain parts of the manuscript , emerged definitely and unmistakably ; and it became obvious that the text was indeed in english .\\n\\non the evening of september second the last major barrier gave way , and dr armitage read for the first time a continuous passage of wilbur whateley\\'s annals . it was in truth a diary , as all had thought ; and it was couched in a style clearly showing the mixed occult erudition and general illiteracy of the strange being who wrote it . almost the first long passage that armitage deciphered , an entry dated november 26 , 1916 , proved highly startling and disquieting . it was written , he remembered , by a child of three and a half who looked like a lad of twelve or thirteen .\\n\\ntoday learned the aklo for the sabaoth (it ran) , which did not like , it being answerable from the hill and not from the air . that upstairs more ahead of me than i had thought it would be , and is not like to have much earth brain . shot elam hutchins\\'s collie jack when he went to bite me , and elam says he would kill me if he dast . i guess he won\\'t . grandfather kept me saying the dho formula last night , and i think i saw the inner city at the 2 magnetic poles . i shall go to those poles when the earth is cleared off , if i can\\'t break through with the dho-hna formula when i commit it . they from the air told me at sabbat that it will be years before i can clear off the earth , and i guess grandfather will be dead then , so i shall have to learn all the angles of the planes and all the formulas between the yr and the nhhngr . they from outside will help , but they cannot take body without human blood . that upstairs looks it will have the right cast . i can see it a little when i make the voorish sign or blow the powder of ibn ghazi at it , and it is near like them at may eve on the hill . the other face may wear off some . i wonder how i shall look when the earth is cleared and there are no earth beings on it . he that came with the aklo sabaoth said i may be transfigured there being much of outside to work on .\\n\\nmorning found dr armitage in a cold sweat of terror and a frenzy of wakeful concentration . he had not left the manuscript all night , but sat at his table under the electric light turning page after page with shaking hands as fast as he could decipher the cryptic text . he had nervously telephoned his wife he would not be home , and when she brought him a breakfast from the house he could scarcely dispose of a mouthful . all that day he read on , now and then halted maddeningly as a reapplication of the complex key became necessary . lunch and dinner were brought him , but he ate only the smallest fraction of either . toward the middle of the next night he drowsed off in his chair , but soon woke out of a tangle of nightmares almost as hideous as the truths and menaces to man\\'s existence that he had uncovered .\\n\\non the morning of september fourth professor rice and dr morgan insisted on seeing him for a while , and departed trembling and ashen-grey . that evening he went to bed , but slept only fitfully . wednesday--the next day--he was back at the manuscript , and began to take copious notes both from the current sections and from those he had already deciphered . in the small hours of that night he slept a little in a easy chair in his office , but was at the manuscript again before dawn . some time before noon his physician , dr hartwell , called to see him and insisted that he cease work . he refused ; intimating that it was of the most vital importance for him to complete the reading of the diary and promising an explanation in due course of time . that evening , just as twilight fell , he finished his terrible perusal and sank back exhausted . his wife , bringing his dinner , found him in a half-comatose state ; but he was conscious enough to warn her off with a sharp cry when he saw her eyes wander toward the notes he had taken . weakly rising , he gathered up the scribbled papers and sealed them all in a great envelope , which he immediately placed in his inside coat pocket . he had sufficient strength to get home , but was so clearly in need of medical aid that dr hartwell was summoned at once . as the doctor put him to bed he could only mutter over and over again , \\'but what , in god\\'s name , can we do ?\\'\\n\\ndr armitage slept , but was partly delirious the next day . he made no explanations to hartwell , but in his calmer moments spoke of the imperative need of a long conference with rice and morgan . his wilder wanderings were very startling indeed , including frantic appeals that something in a boarded-up farmhouse be destroyed , and fantastic references to some plan for the extirpation of the entire human race and all animal and vegetable life from the earth by some terrible elder race of beings from another dimension . he would shout that the world was in danger , since the elder things wished to strip it and drag it away from the solar system and cosmos of matter into some other plane or phase of entity from which it had once fallen , vigintillions of aeons ago . at other times he would call for the dreaded necronomicon and the daemonolatreia of remigius , in which he seemed hopeful of finding some formula to check the peril he conjured up .\\n\\n\\'stop them , stop them !\\' he would shout . \\'those whateleys meant to let them in , and the worst of all is left ! tell rice and morgan we must do something--it\\'s a blind business , but i know how to make the powder . . .it hasn\\'t been fed since the second of august , when wilbur came here to his death , and at that rate . . .\\'\\n\\nbut armitage had a sound physique despite his seventy-three years , and slept off his disorder that night without developing any real fever . he woke late friday , clear of head , though sober with a gnawing fear and tremendous sense of responsibility . saturday afternoon he felt able to go over to the library and summon rice and morgan for a conference , and the rest of that day and evening the three men tortured their brains in the wildest speculation and the most desperate debate . strange and terrible books were drawn voluminously from the stack shelves and from secure places of storage ; and diagrams and formulae were copied with feverish haste and in bewildering abundance . of scepticism there was none . all three had seen the body of wilbur whateley as it lay on the floor in a room of that very building , and after that not one of them could feel even slightly inclined to treat the diary as a madman\\'s raving .\\n\\nopinions were divided as to notifying the massachusetts state police , and the negative finally won . there were things involved which simply could not be believed by those who had not seen a sample , as indeed was made clear during certain subsequent investigations . late at night the conference disbanded without having developed a definite plan , but all day sunday armitage was busy comparing formulae and mixing chemicals obtained from the college laboratory . the more he reflected on the hellish diary , the more he was inclined to doubt the efficacy of any material agent in stamping out the entity which wilbur whateley had left behind him--the earth threatening entity which , unknown to him , was to burst forth in a few hours and become the memorable dunwich horror .\\n\\nmonday was a repetition of sunday with dr armitage , for the task in hand required an infinity of research and experiment . further consultations of the monstrous diary brought about various changes of plan , and he knew that even in the end a large amount of uncertainty must remain . by tuesday he had a definite line of action mapped out , and believed he would try a trip to dunwich within a week . then , on wednesday , the great shock came . tucked obscurely away in a corner of the arkham advertiser was a facetious little item from the associated press , telling what a record-breaking monster the bootleg whisky of dunwich had raised up . armitage , half stunned , could only telephone for rice and morgan . far into the night they discussed , and the next day was a whirlwind of preparation on the part of them all . armitage knew he would be meddling with terrible powers , yet saw that there was no other way to annul the deeper and more malign meddling which others had done before him .\\n\\nix .\\n\\nfriday morning armitage , rice , and morgan set out by motor for dunwich , arriving at the village about one in the afternoon . the day was pleasant , but even in the brightest sunlight a kind of quiet dread and portent seemed to hover about the strangely domed hills and the deep , shadowy ravines of the stricken region . now and then on some mountain top a gaunt circle of stones could be glimpsed against the sky . from the air of hushed fright at osborn\\'s store they knew something hideous had happened , and soon learned of the annihilation of the elmer frye house and family . throughout that afternoon they rode around dunwich , questioning the natives concerning all that had occurred , and seeing for themselves with rising pangs of horror the drear frye ruins with their lingering traces of the tarry stickiness , the blasphemous tracks in the frye yard , the wounded seth bishop cattle , and the enormous swaths of disturbed vegetation in various places . the trail up and down sentinel hill seemed to armitage of almost cataclysmic significance , and he looked long at the sinister altar-like stone on the summit .\\n\\nat length the visitors , apprised of a party of state police which had come from aylesbury that morning in response to the first telephone reports of the frye tragedy , decided to seek out the officers and compare notes as far as practicable . this , however , they found more easily planned than performed ; since no sign of the party could be found in any direction . there had been five of them in a car , but now the car stood empty near the ruins in the frye yard . the natives , all of whom had talked with the policemen , seemed at first as perplexed as armitage and his companions . then old sam hutchins thought of something and turned pale , nudging fred farr and pointing to the dank , deep hollow that yawned close by .\\n\\n\\'gawd ,\\' he gasped , \\'i telled \\'em not ter go daown into the glen , an\\' i never thought nobody\\'d dew it with them tracks an\\' that smell an\\' the whippoorwills a-screechin\\' daown thar in the dark o\\' noonday . . .\\'\\n\\na cold shudder ran through natives and visitors alike , and every ear seemed strained in a kind of instinctive , unconscious listening . armitage , now that he had actually come upon the horror and its monstrous work , trembled with the responsibility he felt to be his . night would soon fall , and it was then that the mountainous blasphemy lumbered upon its eldritch course . negotium perambuians in tenebris . . .the old librarian rehearsed the formulae he had memorized , and clutched the paper containing the alternative one he had not memorized . he saw that his electric flashlight was in working order . rice , beside him , took from a valise a metal sprayer of the sort used in combating insects ; whilst morgan uncased the big-game rifle on which he relied despite his colleague\\'s warnings that no material weapon would be of help .\\n\\narmitage , having read the hideous diary , knew painfully well what kind of a manifestation to expect ; but he did not add to the fright of the dunwich people by giving any hints or clues . he hoped that it might be conquered without any revelation to the world of the monstrous thing it had escaped . as the shadows gathered , the natives commenced to disperse homeward , anxious to bar themselves indoors despite the present evidence that all human locks and bolts were useless before a force that could bend trees and crush houses when it chose . they shook their heads at the visitors\\' plan to stand guard at the frye ruins near the glen ; and , as they left , had little expectancy of ever seeing the watchers again .\\n\\nthere were rumblings under the hills that night , and the whippoorwills piped threateningly . once in a while a wind , sweeping up out of cold spring glen , would bring a touch of ineffable foetor to the heavy night air ; such a foetor as all three of the watchers had smelled once before , when they stood above a dying thing that had passed for fifteen years and a half as a human being . but the looked-for terror did not appear . whatever was down there in the glen was biding its time , and armitage told his colleagues it would be suicidal to try to attack it in the dark .\\n\\nmorning came wanly , and the night-sounds ceased . it was a grey , bleak day , with now and then a drizzle of rain ; and heavier and heavier clouds seemed to be piling themselves up beyond the hills to the north-west . the men from arkham were undecided what to do . seeking shelter from the increasing rainfall beneath one of the few undestroyed frye outbuildings , they debated the wisdom of waiting , or of taking the aggressive and going down into the glen in quest of their nameless , monstrous quarry . the downpour waxed in heaviness , and distant peals of thunder sounded from far horizons . sheet lightning shimmered , and then a forky bolt flashed near at hand , as if descending into the accursed glen itself . the sky grew very dark , and the watchers hoped that the storm would prove a short , sharp one followed by clear weather .\\n\\nit was still gruesomely dark when , not much over an hour later , a confused babel of voices sounded down the road . another moment brought to view a frightened group of more than a dozen men , running , shouting , and even whimpering hysterically . someone in the lead began sobbing out words , and the arkham men started violently when those words developed a coherent form .\\n\\n\\'oh , my gawd , my gawd ,\\' the voice choked out . \\'it\\'s a-goin\\' agin , an\\' this time by day ! it\\'s aout--it\\'s aout an\\' a-movin\\' this very minute , an\\' only the lord knows when it\\'ll be on us all !\\'\\n\\nthe speaker panted into silence , but another took up his message .\\n\\n\\'nigh on a haour ago zeb whateley here heered the \\'phone a-ringin\\' , an\\' it was mis\\' corey , george\\'s wife , that lives daown by the junction . she says the hired boy luther was aout drivin\\' in the caows from the storm arter the big bolt , when he see all the trees a-bendin\\' at the maouth o\\' the glen--opposite side ter this--an\\' smelt the same awful smell like he smelt when he faound the big tracks las\\' monday mornin\\' . an\\' she says he says they was a swishin\\' lappin\\' saound , more nor what the bendin\\' trees an\\' bushes could make , an\\' all on a suddent the trees along the rud begun ter git pushed one side , an\\' they was a awful stompin\\' an\\' splashin\\' in the mud . but mind ye , luther he didn\\'t see nothin\\' at all , only just the bendin\\' trees an\\' underbrush .\\n\\n\\'then fur ahead where bishop\\'s brook goes under the rud he heerd a awful creakin\\' an\\' strainin\\' on the bridge , an\\' says he could tell the saound o\\' wood a-startin\\' to crack an\\' split . an\\' all the whiles he never see a thing , only them trees an\\' bushes a-bendin\\' . an\\' when the swishin\\' saound got very fur off--on the rud towards wizard whateley\\'s an\\' sentinel hill--luther he had the guts ter step up whar he\\'d heerd it fust an\\' look at the graound . it was all mud an\\' water , an\\' the sky was dark , an\\' the rain was wipin\\' aout all tracks abaout as fast as could be ; but beginnin\\' at the glen maouth , whar the trees hed moved , they was still some o\\' them awful prints big as bar\\'ls like he seen monday .\\'\\n\\nat this point the first excited speaker interrupted .\\n\\n\\'but that ain\\'t the trouble naow--that was only the start . zeb here was callin\\' folks up an\\' everybody was a-listenin\\' in when a call from seth bishop\\'s cut in . his haousekeeper sally was carryin\\' on fit to kill--she\\'d jest seed the trees a-bendin\\' beside the rud , an\\' says they was a kind o\\' mushy saound , like a elephant puffin\\' an\\' treadin\\' , a-headin\\' fer the haouse . then she up an\\' spoke suddent of a fearful smell , an\\' says her boy cha\\'ncey was a-screamin\\' as haow it was jest like what he smelt up to the whateley rewins monday mornin\\' . an\\' the dogs was barkin\\' an\\' whinin\\' awful .\\n\\n\\'an\\' then she let aout a turrible yell , an\\' says the shed daown the rud had jest caved in like the storm hed blowed it over , only the wind w\\'an\\'t strong enough to dew that . everybody was a-listenin\\' , an\\' we could hear lots o\\' folks on the wire a-gaspin\\' . all to onct sally she yelled again , an\\' says the front yard picket fence hed just crumbled up , though they wa\\'n\\'t no sign o\\' what done it . then everybody on the line could hear cha\\'ncey an\\' old seth bishop a-yellin\\' tew , an\\' sally was shriekin\\' aout that suthin\\' heavy hed struck the haouse--not lightnin\\' nor nothin\\' , but suthin\\' heavy again\\' the front , that kep\\' a-launchin\\' itself agin an\\' agin , though ye couldn\\'t see nothin\\' aout the front winders . an\\' then . . .an\\' then . . .\\'\\n\\nlines of fright deepened on every face ; and armitage , shaken as he was , had barely poise enough to prompt the speaker .\\n\\n\\'an\\' then . . . .sally she yelled aout , \"o help , the haouse is a-cavin\\' in\" . . .an\\' on the wire we could hear a turrible crashin\\' an\\' a hull flock o\\' screaming . . .jes like when elmer frye\\'s place was took , only wuss . . .\\'\\n\\nthe man paused , and another of the crowd spoke .\\n\\n\\'that\\'s all--not a saound nor squeak over the \\'phone arter that . jest still-like . we that heerd it got aout fords an\\' wagons an\\' rounded up as many able-bodied men-folks as we could git , at corey\\'s place , an\\' come up here ter see what yew thought best ter dew . not but what i think it\\'s the lord\\'s jedgment fer our iniquities , that no mortal kin ever set aside .\\'\\n\\narmitage saw that the time for positive action had come , and spoke decisively to the faltering group of frightened rustics .\\n\\n\\'we must follow it , boys .\\' he made his voice as reassuring as possible . \\'i believe there\\'s a chance of putting it out of business . you men know that those whateleys were wizards--well , this thing is a thing of wizardry , and must be put down by the same means . i\\'ve seen wilbur whateley\\'s diary and read some of the strange old books he used to read ; and i think i know the right kind of spell to recite to make the thing fade away . of course , one can\\'t be sure , but we can always take a chance . it\\'s invisible--i knew it would be--but there\\'s powder in this long-distance sprayer that might make it show up for a second . later on we\\'ll try it . it\\'s a frightful thing to have alive , but it isn\\'t as bad as what wilbur would have let in if he\\'d lived longer . you\\'ll never know what the world escaped . now we\\'ve only this one thing to fight , and it can\\'t multiply . it can , though , do a lot of harm ; so we mustn\\'t hesitate to rid the community of it .\\n\\n\\'we must follow it--and the way to begin is to go to the place that has just been wrecked . let somebody lead the way--i don\\'t know your roads very well , but i\\'ve an idea there might be a shorter cut across lots . how about it ?\\'\\n\\nthe men shuffled about a moment , and then earl sawyer spoke softly , pointing with a grimy finger through the steadily lessening rain .\\n\\n\\'i guess ye kin git to seth bishop\\'s quickest by cuttin\\' across the lower medder here , wadin\\' the brook at the low place , an\\' climbin\\' through carrier\\'s mowin\\' an\\' the timber-lot beyont . that comes aout on the upper rud mighty nigh seth\\'s--a leetle t\\'other side .\\'\\n\\narmitage , with rice and morgan , started to walk in the direction indicated ; and most of the natives followed slowly . the sky was growing lighter , and there were signs that the storm had worn itself away . when armitage inadvertently took a wrong direction , joe osborn warned him and walked ahead to show the right one . courage and confidence were mounting , though the twilight of the almost perpendicular wooded hill which lay towards the end of their short cut , and among whose fantastic ancient trees they had to scramble as if up a ladder , put these qualities to a severe test .\\n\\nat length they emerged on a muddy road to find the sun coming out . they were a little beyond the seth bishop place , but bent trees and hideously unmistakable tracks showed what had passed by . only a few moments were consumed in surveying the ruins just round the bend . it was the frye incident all over again , and nothing dead or living was found in either of the collapsed shells which had been the bishop house and barn . no one cared to remain there amidst the stench and tarry stickiness , but all turned instinctively to the line of horrible prints leading on towards the wrecked whateley farmhouse and the altar-crowned slopes of sentinel hill .\\n\\nas the men passed the site of wilbur whateley\\'s abode they shuddered visibly , and seemed again to mix hesitancy with their zeal . it was no joke tracking down something as big as a house that one could not see , but that had all the vicious malevolence of a daemon . opposite the base of sentinel hill the tracks left the road , and there was a fresh bending and matting visible along the broad swath marking the monster\\'s former route to and from the summit .\\n\\narmitage produced a pocket telescope of considerable power and scanned the steep green side of the hill . then he handed the instrument to morgan , whose sight was keener . after a moment of gazing morgan cried out sharply , passing the glass to earl sawyer and indicating a certain spot on the slope with his finger . sawyer , as clumsy as most non-users of optical devices are , fumbled a while ; but eventually focused the lenses with armitage\\'s aid . when he did so his cry was less restrained than morgan\\'s had been .\\n\\n\\'gawd almighty , the grass an\\' bushes is a\\'movin\\' ! it\\'s a-goin\\' up--slow-like--creepin\\'--up ter the top this minute , heaven only knows what fur !\\'\\n\\nthen the germ of panic seemed to spread among the seekers . it was one thing to chase the nameless entity , but quite another to find it . spells might be all right--but suppose they weren\\'t ? voices began questioning armitage about what he knew of the thing , and no reply seemed quite to satisfy . everyone seemed to feel himself in close proximity to phases of nature and of being utterly forbidden and wholly outside the sane experience of mankind .\\n\\nx .\\n\\nin the end the three men from arkham--old , white-bearded dr armitage , stocky , iron-grey professor rice , and lean , youngish dr morgan , ascended the mountain alone . after much patient instruction regarding its focusing and use , they left the telescope with the frightened group that remained in the road ; and as they climbed they were watched closely by those among whom the glass was passed round . it was hard going , and armitage had to be helped more than once . high above the toiling group the great swath trembled as its hellish maker repassed with snail-like deliberateness . then it was obvious that the pursuers were gaining .\\n\\ncurtis whateley--of the undecayed branch--was holding the telescope when the arkham party detoured radically from the swath . he told the crowd that the men were evidently trying to get to a subordinate peak which overlooked the swath at a point considerably ahead of where the shrubbery was now bending . this , indeed , proved to be true ; and the party were seen to gain the minor elevation only a short time after the invisible blasphemy had passed it .\\n\\nthen wesley corey , who had taken the glass , cried out that armitage was adjusting the sprayer which rice held , and that something must be about to happen . the crowd stirred uneasily , recalling that his sprayer was expected to give the unseen horror a moment of visibility . two or three men shut their eyes , but curtis whateley snatched back the telescope and strained his vision to the utmost . he saw that rice , from the party\\'s point of advantage above and behind the entity , had an excellent chance of spreading the potent powder with marvellous effect .\\n\\nthose without the telescope saw only an instant\\'s flash of grey cloud--a cloud about the size of a moderately large building--near the top of the mountain . curtis , who held the instrument , dropped it with a piercing shriek into the ankle-deep mud of the road . he reeled , and would have crumbled to the ground had not two or three others seized and steadied him . all he could do was moan half-inaudibly .\\n\\n\\'oh , oh , great gawd . . .that . . .that . . .\\'\\n\\nthere was a pandemonium of questioning , and only henry wheeler thought to rescue the fallen telescope and wipe it clean of mud . curtis was past all coherence , and even isolated replies were almost too much for him .\\n\\n\\'bigger\\'n a barn . . .all made o\\' squirmin\\' ropes . . .hull thing sort o\\' shaped like a hen\\'s egg bigger\\'n anything with dozens o\\' legs like hogs-heads that haff shut up when they step . . .nothin\\' solid abaout it--all like jelly , an\\' made o\\' sep\\'rit wrigglin\\' ropes pushed clost together . . .great bulgin\\' eyes all over it . . .ten or twenty maouths or trunks a-stickin\\' aout all along the sides , big as stove-pipes an all a-tossin\\' an openin\\' an\\' shuttin\\' . . .all grey , with kinder blue or purple rings . . .an\\' gawd it heaven--that haff face on top . . .\\'\\n\\nthis final memory , whatever it was , proved too much for poor curtis ; and he collapsed completely before he could say more . fred farr and will hutchins carried him to the roadside and laid him on the damp grass . henry wheeler , trembling , turned the rescued telescope on the mountain to see what he might . through the lenses were discernible three tiny figures , apparently running towards the summit as fast as the steep incline allowed . only these--nothing more . then everyone noticed a strangely unseasonable noise in the deep valley behind , and even in the underbrush of sentinel hill itself . it was the piping of unnumbered whippoorwills , and in their shrill chorus there seemed to lurk a note of tense and evil expectancy .\\n\\nearl sawyer now took the telescope and reported the three figures as standing on the topmost ridge , virtually level with the altar-stone but at a considerable distance from it . one figure , he said , seemed to be raising its hands above its head at rhythmic intervals ; and as sawyer mentioned the circumstance the crowd seemed to hear a faint , half-musical sound from the distance , as if a loud chant were accompanying the gestures . the weird silhouette on that remote peak must have been a spectacle of infinite grotesqueness and impressiveness , but no observer was in a mood for aesthetic appreciation . \\'i guess he\\'s sayin\\' the spell ,\\' whispered wheeler as he snatched back the telescope . the whippoorwills were piping wildly , and in a singularly curious irregular rhythm quite unlike that of the visible ritual .\\n\\nsuddenly the sunshine seemed to lessen without the intervention of any discernible cloud . it was a very peculiar phenomenon , and was plainly marked by all . a rumbling sound seemed brewing beneath the hills , mixed strangely with a concordant rumbling which clearly came from the sky . lightning flashed aloft , and the wondering crowd looked in vain for the portents of storm . the chanting of the men from arkham now became unmistakable , and wheeler saw through the glass that they were all raising their arms in the rhythmic incantation . from some farmhouse far away came the frantic barking of dogs .\\n\\nthe change in the quality of the daylight increased , and the crowd gazed about the horizon in wonder . a purplish darkness , born of nothing more than a spectral deepening of the sky\\'s blue , pressed down upon the rumbling hills . then the lightning flashed again , somewhat brighter than before , and the crowd fancied that it had showed a certain mistiness around the altar-stone on the distant height . no one , however , had been using the telescope at that instant . the whippoorwills continued their irregular pulsation , and the men of dunwich braced themselves tensely against some imponderable menace with which the atmosphere seemed surcharged .\\n\\nwithout warning came those deep , cracked , raucous vocal sounds which will never leave the memory of the stricken group who heard them . not from any human throat were they born , for the organs of man can yield no such acoustic perversions . rather would one have said they came from the pit itself , had not their source been so unmistakably the altar-stone on the peak . it is almost erroneous to call them sounds at all , since so much of their ghastly , infra-bass timbre spoke to dim seats of consciousness and terror far subtler than the ear ; yet one must do so , since their form was indisputably though vaguely that of half-articulate words . they were loud--loud as the rumblings and the thunder above which they echoed--yet did they come from no visible being . and because imagination might suggest a conjectural source in the world of non-visible beings , the huddled crowd at the mountain\\'s base huddled still closer , and winced as if in expectation of a blow .\\n\\nygnailh . . .ygnaiih . . .thflthkh\\'ngha . . . .yog-sothoth . . .rang the hideous croaking out of space . y\\'bthnk . . .h\\'ehye--n\\'grkdl\\'lh . . .\\n\\nthe speaking impulse seemed to falter here , as if some frightful psychic struggle were going on . henry wheeler strained his eye at the telescope , but saw only the three grotesquely silhouetted human figures on the peak , all moving their arms furiously in strange gestures as their incantation drew near its culmination . from what black wells of acherontic fear or feeling , from what unplumbed gulfs of cosmic consciousness or obscure , long-latent heredity , were those half-articulate thunder-croakings drawn ? presently they began to gather renewed force and coherence as they grew in stark , utter , ultimate frenzy .\\n\\neh-y-ya-ya-yahaah--e\\'yayayaaaa . . .ngh\\'aaaaa . . .ngh\\'aaa . . . h\\'yuh . . .h\\'yuh . . .help ! help ! . . .ff--ff--ff--father ! father ! yog-sothoth ! . . .\\n\\nbut that was all . the pallid group in the road , still reeling at the indisputably english syllables that had poured thickly and thunderously down from the frantic vacancy beside that shocking altar-stone , were never to hear such syllables again . instead , they jumped violently at the terrific report which seemed to rend the hills ; the deafening , cataclysmic peal whose source , be it inner earth or sky , no hearer was ever able to place . a single lightning bolt shot from the purple zenith to the altar-stone , and a great tidal wave of viewless force and indescribable stench swept down from the hill to all the countryside . trees , grass , and under-brush were whipped into a fury ; and the frightened crowd at the mountain\\'s base , weakened by the lethal foetor that seemed about to asphyxiate them , were almost hurled off their feet . dogs howled from the distance , green grass and foliage wilted to a curious , sickly yellow-grey , and over field and forest were scattered the bodies of dead whippoorwills .\\n\\nthe stench left quickly , but the vegetation never came right again . to this day there is something queer and unholy about the growths on and around that fearsome hill curtis whateley was only just regaining consciousness when the arkham men came slowly down the mountain in the beams of a sunlight once more brilliant and untainted . they were grave and quiet , and seemed shaken by memories and reflections even more terrible than those which had reduced the group of natives to a state of cowed quivering . in reply to a jumble of questions they only shook their heads and reaffirmed one vital fact .\\n\\n\\'the thing has gone for ever ,\\' armitage said . \\'it has been split up into what it was originally made of , and can never exist again . it was an impossibility in a normal world . only the least fraction was really matter in any sense we know . it was like its father--and most of it has gone back to him in some vague realm or dimension outside our material universe ; some vague abyss out of which only the most accursed rites of human blasphemy could ever have called him for a moment on the hills .\\'\\n\\nthere was a brief silence , and in that pause the scattered senses of poor curtis whateley began to knit back into a sort of continuity ; so that he put his hands to his head with a moan . memory seemed to pick itself up where it had left off , and the horror of the sight that had prostrated him burst in upon him again .\\n\\n\\'oh , oh , my gawd , that haff face--that haff face on top of it . . . that face with the red eyes an\\' crinkly albino hair , an\\' no chin , like the whateleys . . .it was a octopus , centipede , spider kind o\\' thing , but they was a haff-shaped man\\'s face on top of it , an\\' it looked like wizard whateley\\'s , only it was yards an\\' yards acrost . . . .\\'\\n\\nhe paused exhausted , as the whole group of natives stared in a bewilderment not quite crystallized into fresh terror . only old zebulon whateley , who wanderingly remembered ancient things but who had been silent heretofore , spoke aloud .\\n\\n\\'fifteen year\\' gone ,\\' he rambled , \\'i heered ol\\' whateley say as haow some day we\\'d hear a child o\\' lavinny\\'s a-callin\\' its father\\'s name on the top o\\' sentinel hill . . .\\'\\n\\nbut joe osborn interrupted him to question the arkham men anew .\\n\\n\\'what was it , anyhaow , an\\' haowever did young wizard whateley call it aout o\\' the air it come from ?\\'\\n\\narmitage chose his words very carefully .\\n\\n\\'it was--well , it was mostly a kind of force that doesn\\'t belong in our part of space ; a kind of force that acts and grows and shapes itself by other laws than those of our sort of nature . we have no business calling in such things from outside , and only very wicked people and very wicked cults ever try to . there was some of it in wilbur whateley himself--enough to make a devil and a precocious monster of him , and to make his passing out a pretty terrible sight . i\\'m going to burn his accursed diary , and if you men are wise you\\'ll dynamite that altar-stone up there , and pull down all the rings of standing stones on the other hills . things like that brought down the beings those whateleys were so fond of--the beings they were going to let in tangibly to wipe out the human race and drag the earth off to some nameless place for some nameless purpose .\\n\\n\\'but as to this thing we\\'ve just sent back--the whateleys raised it for a terrible part in the doings that were to come . it grew fast and big from the same reason that wilbur grew fast and big--but it beat him because it had a greater share of the outsideness in it . you needn\\'t ask how wilbur called it out of the air . he didn\\'t call it out . it was his twin brother , but it looked more like the father than he did .\\'\\n', shape=(), dtype=string)\n",
            "tf.Tensor(b'the other gods\\n\\nbut now they have betaken themselves to unknown kadath in the cold waste where no man treads , and are grown stern , having no higher peak whereto to flee at the coming of men . they are grown stern , and where once they suffered men to displace them , they now forbid men to come ; or coming , to depart . it is well for men that they know not of kadath in the cold waste ; else they would seek injudiciously to scale it .\\n\\nsometimes when earth\\'s gods are homesick they visit in the still of the night the peaks where once they dwelt , and weep softly as they try to play in the olden way on remembered slopes . men have felt the tears of the gods on white-capped thurai , though they have thought it rain ; and have heard the sighs of the gods in the plaintive dawn-winds of lerion . in cloud-ships the gods are wont to travel , and wise cotters have legends that keep them from certain high peaks at night when it is cloudy , for the gods are not lenient as of old .\\n\\nin ulthar , which lies beyond the river skai , once dwelt an old man avid to behold the gods of earth ; a man deeply learned in the seven cryptical books of earth , and familiar with the pnakotic manuscripts of distant and frozen lomar . his name was barzai the wise , and the villagers tell of how he went up a mountain on the night of the strange eclipse .\\n\\nbarzai knew so much of the gods that he could tell of their comings and goings , and guessed so many of their secrets that he was deemed half a god himself . it was he who wisely advised the burgesses of ulthar when they passed their remarkable law against the slaying of cats , and who first told the young priest atal where it is that black cats go at midnight on st . john\\'s eve . barzai was learned in the lore of the earth\\'s gods , and had gained a desire to look upon their faces . he believed that his great secret knowledge of gods could shield him from their wrath , so resolved to go up to the summit of high and rocky hatheg-kla on a night when he knew the gods would be there .\\n\\nhatheg-kla is far in the stony desert beyond hatheg , for which it is named , and rises like a rock statue in a silent temple . around its peak the mists play always mournfully , for mists are the memories of the gods , and the gods loved hatheg-kla when they dwelt upon it in the old days . often the gods of earth visit hatheg-kla in their ships of clouds , casting pale vapors over the slopes as they dance reminiscently on the summit under a clear moon . the villagers of hatheg say it is ill to climb the hatheg-kla at any time , and deadly to climb it by night when pale vapors hide the summit and the moon ; but barzai heeded them not when he came from neighboring ulthar with the young priest atal , who was his disciple . atal was only the son of an innkeeper , and was sometimes afraid ; but barzai\\'s father had been a landgrave who dwelt in an ancient castle , so he had no common superstition in his blood , and only laughed at the fearful cotters .\\n\\nbanzai and atal went out of hatheg into the stony desert despite the prayers of peasants , and talked of earth\\'s gods by their campfires at night . many days they traveled , and from afar saw lofty hatheg-kla with his aureole of mournful mist . on the thirteenth day they reached the mountain\\'s lonely base , and atal spoke of his fears . but barzai was old and learned and had no fears , so led the way up the slope that no man had scaled since the time of sansu , who is written of with fright in the moldy pnakotic manuscripts .\\n\\nthe way was rocky , and made perilous by chasms , cliffs , and falling stones . later it grew cold and snowy ; and barzai and atal often slipped and fell as they hewed and plodded upward with staves and axes . finally the air grew thin , and the sky changed color , and the climbers found it hard to breathe ; but still they toiled up and up , marveling at the strangeness of the scene and thrilling at the thought of what would happen on the summit when the moon was out and the pale vapours spread around . for three days they climbed higher and higher toward the roof of the world ; then they camped to wait for the clouding of the moon .\\n\\nfor four nights no clouds came , and the moon shone down cold through the thin mournful mist around the silent pinnacle . then on the fifth night , which was the night of the full moon , barzai saw some dense clouds far to the north , and stayed up with atal to watch them draw near . thick and majestic they sailed , slowly and deliberately onward ; ranging themselves round the peak high above the watchers , and hiding the moon and the summit from view . for a long hour the watchers gazed , whilst the vapours swirled and the screen of clouds grew thicker and more restless . barzai was wise in the lore of earth\\'s gods , and listened hard for certain sounds , but atal felt the chill of the vapours and the awe of the night , and feared much . and when barzai began to climb higher and beckon eagerly , it was long before atal would follow .\\n\\nso thick were the vapours that the way was hard , and though atal followed at last , he could scarce see the gray shape of barzai on the dim slope above in the clouded moonlight . barzai forged very far ahead , and seemed despite his age to climb more easily than atal ; fearing not the steepness that began to grow too great for any save a strong and dauntless man , nor pausing at wide black chasms that atal could scarce leap . and so they went up wildly over rocks and gulfs , slipping and stumbling , and sometimes awed at the vastness and horrible silence of bleak ice pinnacles and mute granite steeps .\\n\\nvery suddenly barzai went out of atal\\'s sight , scaling a hideous cliff that seemed to bulge outward and block the path for any climber not inspired of earth\\'s gods . atal was far below , and planning what he should do when he reached the place , when curiously he noticed that the light had grown strong , as if the cloudless peak and moonlit meetingplace of the gods were very near . and as he scrambled on toward the bulging cliff and litten sky he felt fears more shocking than any he had known before . then through the high mists he heard the voice of barzai shouting wildly in delight :\\n\\n\"i have heard the gods . i have heard earth\\'s gods singing in revelry on hatheg-kla ! the voices of earth\\'s gods are known to barzai the prophet ! the mists are thin and the moon is bright , and i shall see the gods dancing wildly on hatheg-kla that they loved in youth . the wisdom of barzai hath made him greater than earth\\'s gods , and against his will their spells and barriers are as naught ; barzai will behold the gods , the proud gods , the secret gods , the gods of earth who spurn the sight of man !\"\\n\\natal could not hear the voices barzai heard , but he was now close to the bulging cliff and scanning it for footholds . then he heard barzai\\'s voice grow shriller and louder :\\n\\n\"the mist is very thin , and the moon casts shadows on the slope ; the voices of earth\\'s gods are high and wild , and they fear the coming of barzai the wise , who is greater than they . . .the moon\\'s light flickers , as earth\\'s gods dance against it ; i shall see the dancing forms of the gods that leap and howl in the moonlight . . .the light is dimmer and the gods are afraid . . .\"\\n\\nwhilst barzai was shouting these things atal felt a spectral change in all the air , as if the laws of earth were bowing to greater laws ; for though the way was steeper than ever , the upward path was now grown fearsomely easy , and the bulging cliff proved scarce an obstacle when he reached it and slid perilously up its convex face . the light of the moon had strangely failed , and as atal plunged upward through the mists he heard barzai the wise shrieking in the shadows :\\n\\n\"the moon is dark , and the gods dance in the night ; there is terror in the sky , for upon the moon hath sunk an eclipse foretold in no books of men or of earth\\'s gods . . .there is unknown magic on hatheg-kla , for the screams of the frightened gods have turned to laughter , and the slopes of ice shoot up endlessly into the black heavens whither i am plunging . . .hei ! hei ! at last ! in the dim light i behold the gods of earth !\"\\n\\nand now atal , slipping dizzily up over inconceivable steeps , heard in the dark a loathsome laughing , mixed with such a cry as no man else ever heard save in the phlegethon of unrelatable nightmares ; a cry wherein reverberated the horror and anguish of a haunted lifetime packed into one atrocious moment :\\n\\n\"the other gods ! the other gods ! the gods of the outer hells that guard the feeble gods of earth ! . . .look away . . .go back . . .do not see ! do not see ! the vengeance of the infinite abysses . . .that cursed , that damnable pit . . .merciful gods of earth , i am falling into the sky !\"\\n\\nand as atal shut his eyes and stopped his ears and tried to hump downward against the frightful pull from unknown heights , there resounded on hatheg-kla that terrible peal of thunder which awaked the good cotters of the plains and the honest burgesses of hatheg , nir and ulthar , and caused them to behold through the clouds that strange eclipse of the moon that no book ever predicted . and when the moon came out at last atal was safe on the lower snows of the mountain without sight of earth\\'s gods , or of the other gods .\\n\\nnow it is told in the moldy pnakotic manuscripts that sansu found naught but wordless ice and rock when he did climb hatheg-kla in the youth of the world . yet when the men of ulthar and nir and hatheg crushed their fears and scaled that haunted steep by day in search of barzai the wise , they found graven in the naked stone of the summit a curious and cyclopean symbol fifty cubits wide , as if the rock had been riven by some titanic chisel . and the symbol was like to one that learned men have discerned in those frightful parts of the pnakotic manuscripts which were too ancient to be read . this they found .\\n\\nbarzai the wise they never found , nor could the holy priest atal ever be persuaded to pray for his soul\\'s repose . moreover , to this day the people of ulthar and nir and hatheg fear eclipses , and pray by night when pale vapors hide the mountain-top and the moon . and above the mists on hatheg-kla , earth\\'s gods sometimes dance reminiscently ; for they know they are safe , and love to come from unknown kadath in ships of clouds and play in the olden way , as they did when earth was new and men not given to the climbing of inaccessible places .\\n', shape=(), dtype=string)\n",
            "tf.Tensor(b\"imprisoned with the pharaohs\\n\\nmystery attracts mystery . ever since the wide appearance of my name as a performer of unexplained feats , i have encountered strange narratives and events which my calling has led people to link with my interests and activities . some of these have been trivial and irrelevant , some deeply dramatic and absorbing , some productive of weird and perilous experiences and some involving me in extensive scientific and historical research . many of these matters i have told and shall continue to tell very freely ; but there is one of which i speak with great reluctance , and which i am now relating only after a session of grilling persuasion from the publishers of this magazine , who had heard vague rumors of it from other members of my family .\\n\\nthe hitherto guarded subject pertains to my non-professional visit to egypt fourteen years ago , and has been avoided by me for several reasons . for one thing , i am averse to exploiting certain unmistakably actual facts and conditions obviously unknown to the myriad tourists who throng about the pyramids and apparently secreted with much diligence by the authorities at cairo , who cannot be wholly ignorant of them . for another thing , i dislike to recount an incident in which my own fantastic imagination must have played so great a part . what i saw--or thought i saw--certainly did not take place ; but is rather to be viewed as a result of my then recent readings in egyptology , and of the speculations anent this theme which my environment naturally prompted . these imaginative stimuli , magnified by the excitement of an actual event terrible enough in itself , undoubtedly gave rise to the culminating horror of that grotesque night so long past .\\n\\nin january , 1910 , i had finished a professional engagement in england and signed a contract for a tour of australian theatres . a liberal time being allowed for the trip , i determined to make the most of it in the sort of travel which chiefly interests me ; so accompanied by my wife i drifted pleasantly down the continent and embarked at marseilles on the p &amp ; o steamer malwa , bound for port said . from that point i proposed to visit the principal historical localities of lower egypt before leaving finally for australia .\\n\\nthe voyage was an agreeable one , and enlivened by many of the amusing incidents which befall a magical performer apart from his work . i had intended , for the sake of quiet travel , to keep my name a secret ; but was goaded into betraying myself by a fellow-magician whose anxiety to astound the passengers with ordinary tricks tempted me to duplicate and exceed his feats in a manner quite destructive of my incognito . i mention this because of its ultimate effect--an effect i should have foreseen before unmasking to a shipload of tourists about to scatter throughout the nile valley . what it did was to herald my identity wherever i subsequently went , and deprive my wife and me of all the placid inconspicuousness we had sought . traveling to seek curiosities , i was often forced to stand inspection as a sort of curiosity myself !\\n\\nwe had come to egypt in search of the picturesque and the mystically impressive , but found little enough when the ship edged up to port said and discharged its passengers in small boats . low dunes of sand , bobbing buoys in shallow water , and a drearily european small town with nothing of interest save the great de lesseps statue , made us anxious to get to something more worth our while . after some discussion we decided to proceed at once to cairo and the pyramids , later going to alexandria for the australian boat and for whatever greco-roman sights that ancient metropolis might present .\\n\\nthe railway journey was tolerable enough , and consumed only four hours and a half . we saw much of the suez canal , whose route we followed as far as ismailiya and later had a taste of old egypt in our glimpse of the restored fresh-water canal of the middle empire . then at last we saw cairo glimmering through the growing dusk ; a winkling constellation which became a blaze as we halted at the great gare centrale .\\n\\nbut once more disappointment awaited us , for all that we beheld was european save the costumes and the crowds . a prosaic subway led to a square teeming with carriages , taxicabs , and trolley-cars and gorgeous with electric lights shining on tall buildings ; whilst the very theatre where i was vainly requested to play and which i later attended as a spectator , had recently been renamed the 'american cosmograph' . we stopped at shepheard's hotel , reached in a taxi that sped along broad , smartly built-up streets ; and amidst the perfect service of its restaurant , elevators and generally anglo-american luxuries the mysterious east and immemorial past seemed very far away .\\n\\nthe next day , however , precipitated us delightfully into the heart of the arabian nights atmosphere ; and in the winding ways and exotic skyline of cairo , the bagdad of harun-al-rashid seemed to live again . guided by our baedeker , we had struck east past the ezbekiyeh gardens along the mouski in quest of the native quarter , and were soon in the hands of a clamorous cicerone who--notwithstanding later developments--was assuredly a master at his trade .\\n\\nnot until afterward did i see that i should have applied at the hotel for a licensed guide . this man , a shaven , peculiarly hollow-voiced and relatively cleanly fellow who looked like a pharaoh and called himself 'abdul reis el drogman' appeared to have much power over others of his kind ; though subsequently the police professed not to know him , and to suggest that reis is merely a name for any person in authority , whilst 'drogman' is obviously no more than a clumsy modification of the word for a leader of tourist parties--dragoman .\\n\\nabdul led us among such wonders as we had before only read and dreamed of . old cairo is itself a story-book and a dream--labyrinths of narrow alleys redolent of aromatic secrets ; arabesque balconies and oriels nearly meeting above the cobbled streets ; maelstroms of oriental traffic with strange cries , cracking whips , rattling carts , jingling money , and braying donkeys ; kaleidoscopes of polychrome robes , veils , turbans , and tarbushes ; water-carriers and dervishes , dogs and cats , soothsayers and barbers ; and over all the whining of blind beggars crouched in alcoves , and the sonorous chanting of muezzins from minarets limned delicately against a sky of deep , unchanging blue .\\n\\nthe roofed , quieter bazaars were hardly less alluring . spice , perfume , incense beads , rugs , silks , and brass--old mahmoud suleiman squats cross-legged amidst his gummy bottles while chattering youths pulverize mustard in the hollowed-out capital of an ancient classic column--a roman corinthian , perhaps from neighboring heliopolis , where augustus stationed one of his three egyptian legions . antiquity begins to mingle with exoticism . and then the mosques and the museum--we saw them all , and tried not to let our arabian revel succumb to the darker charm of pharaonic egypt which the museum's priceless treasures offered . that was to be our climax , and for the present we concentrated on the mediaeval saracenic glories of the califs whose magnificent tomb-mosques form a glittering faery necropolis on the edge of the arabian desert .\\n\\nat length abdul took us along the sharia mohammed ali to the ancient mosque of sultan hassan , and the tower-flanked babel-azab , beyond which climbs the steep-walled pass to the mighty citadel that saladin himself built with the stones of forgotten pyramids . it was sunset when we scaled that cliff , circled the modern mosque of mohammed ali , and looked down from the dizzy parapet over mystic cairo--mystic cairo all golden with its carven domes , its ethereal minarets and its flaming gardens .\\n\\nfar over the city towered the great roman dome of the new museum ; and beyond it--across the cryptic yellow nile that is the mother of eons and dynasties--lurked the menacing sands of the libyan desert , undulant and iridescent and evil with older arcana .\\n\\nthe red sun sank low , bringing the relentless chill of egyptian dusk ; and as it stood poised on the world's rim like that ancient god of heliopolis--re-harakhte , the horizon-sun--we saw silhouetted against its vermeil holocaust the black outlines of the pyramids of gizeh--the palaeogean tombs there were hoary with a thousand years when tut-ankh--amen mounted his golden throne in distant thebes . then we knew that we were done with saracen cairo , and that we must taste the deeper mysteries of primal egypt--the black kem of re and amen , isis and osiris .\\n\\nthe next morning we visited the pyramids , riding out in a victoria across the island of chizereh with its massive lebbakh trees , and the smaller english bridge to the western shore . down the shore road we drove , between great rows of lebbakhs and past the vast zoological gardens to the suburb of gizeh , where a new bridge to cairo proper has since been built . then , turning inland along the sharia-el-haram , we crossed a region of glassy canals and shabby native villages till before us loomed the objects of our quest , cleaving the mists of dawn and forming inverted replicas in the roadside pools . forty centuries , as napoleon had told his campaigners there , indeed looked down upon us .\\n\\nthe road now rose abruptly , till we finally reached our place of transfer between the trolley station and the mena house hotel . abdul reis , who capably purchased our pyramid tickets , seemed to have an understanding with the crowding , yelling and offensive bedouins who inhabited a squalid mud village some distance away and pestiferously assailed every traveler ; for he kept them very decently at bay and secured an excellent pair of camels for us , himself mounting a donkey and assigning the leadership of our animals to a group of men and boys more expensive than useful . the area to be traversed was so small that camels were hardly needed , but we did not regret adding to our experience this troublesome form of desert navigation .\\n\\nthe pyramids stand on a high rock plateau , this group forming next to the northernmost of the series of regal and aristocratic cemeteries built in the neighborhood of the extinct capital memphis , which lay on the same side of the nile , somewhat south of gizeh , and which flourished between 3400 and 2000 b .c . the greatest pyramid , which lies nearest the modern road , was built by king cheops or khufu about 2800 b .c . , and stands more than 450 feet in perpendicular height . in a line southwest from this are successively the second pyramid , built a generation later by king khephren , and though slightly smaller , looking even larger because set on higher ground , and the radically smaller third pyramid of king mycerinus , built about 2700 b .c . near the edge of the plateau and due east of the second pyramid , with a face probably altered to form a colossal portrait of khephren , its royal restorer , stands the monstrous sphinx--mute , sardonic , and wise beyond mankind and memory .\\n\\nminor pyramids and the traces of ruined minor pyramids are found in several places , and the whole plateau is pitted with the tombs of dignitaries of less than royal rank . these latter were originally marked by mastabas , or stone bench-like structures about the deep burial shafts , as found in other memphian cemeteries and exemplified by perneb's tomb in the metropolitan museum of new york . at gizeh , however , all such visible things have been swept away by time and pillage ; and only the rock-hewn shafts , either sand-filled or cleared out by archaeologists , remain to attest their former existence . connected with each tomb was a chapel in which priests and relatives offered food and prayer to the hovering ka or vital principle of the deceased . the small tombs have their chapels contained in their stone mastabas or superstructures , but the mortuary chapels of the pyramids , where regal pharaohs lay , were separate temples , each to the east of its corresponding pyramid , and connected by a causeway to a massive gate-chapel or propylon at the edge of the rock plateau .\\n\\nthe gate-chapel leading to the second pyramid , nearly buried in the drifting sands , yawns subterraneously south-east of the sphinx . persistent tradition dubs it the 'temple of the sphinx' ; and it may perhaps be rightly called such if the sphinx indeed represents the second pyramid's builder khephren . there are unpleasant tales of the sphinx before khephren--but whatever its elder features were , the monarch replaced them with his own that men might look at the colossus without fear .\\n\\nit was in the great gateway-temple that the life-size diorite statue of khephren now in the cairo museum was found ; a statue before which i stood in awe when i beheld it . whether the whole edifice is now excavated i am not certain , but in 1910 most of it was below ground , with the entrance heavily barred at night . germans were in charge of the work , and the war or other things may have stopped them . i would give much , in view of my experience and of certain bedouin whisperings discredited or unknown in cairo , to know what has developed in connection with a certain well in a transverse gallery where statues of the pharaoh were found in curious juxtaposition to the statues of baboons .\\n\\nthe road , as we traversed it on our camels that morning , curved sharply past the wooden police quarters , post office , drug store and shops on the left , and plunged south and east in a complete bend that scaled the rock plateau and brought us face to face with the desert under the lee of the great pyramid . past cyclopean masonry we rode , rounding the eastern face and looking down ahead into a valley of minor pyramids beyond which the eternal nile glistened to the east , and the eternal desert shimmered to the west . very close loomed the three major pyramids , the greatest devoid of outer casing and showing its bulk of great stones , but the others retaining here and there the neatly fitted covering which had made them smooth and finished in their day .\\n\\npresently we descended toward the sphinx , and sat silent beneath the spell of those terrible unseeing eyes . on the vast stone breast we faintly discerned the emblem of re-harakhte , for whose image the sphinx was mistaken in a late dynasty ; and though sand covered the tablet between the great paws , we recalled what thutmosis iv inscribed thereon , and the dream he had when a prince . it was then that the smile of the sphinx vaguely displeased us , and made us wonder about the legends of subterranean passages beneath the monstrous creature , leading down , down , to depths none might dare hint at--depths connected with mysteries older than the dynastic egypt we excavate , and having a sinister relation to the persistence of abnormal , animal--headed gods in the ancient nilotic pantheon . then , too , it was i asked myself in idle question whose hideous significance was not to appear for many an hour .\\n\\nother tourists now began to overtake us , and we moved on to the sand--choked temple of the sphinx , fifty yards to the southeast , which i have previously mentioned as the great gate of the causeway to the second pyramid's mortuary chapel on the plateau . most of it was still underground , and although we dismounted and descended through a modern passageway to its alabaster corridor and pillared hall , i felt that abdul and the local german attendant had not shown us all there was to see .\\n\\nafter this we made the conventional circuit of the pyramid plateau , examining the second pyramid and the peculiar ruins of its mortuary chapel to the east , the third pyramid and its miniature southern satellites and ruined eastern chapel , the rock tombs and the honeycombings of the fourth and fifth dynasties , and the famous campbell's tomb whose shadowy shaft sinks precipitously for fifty-three feet to a sinister sarcophagus which one of our camel drivers divested of the cumbering sand after a vertiginous descent by rope .\\n\\ncries now assailed us from the great pyramid , where bedouins were besieging a party of tourists with offers of speed in the performance of solitary trips up and down . seven minutes is said to be the record for such an ascent and descent , but many lusty sheiks and sons of sheiks assured us they could cut it to five if given the requisite impetus of liberal baksheesh . they did not get this impetus , though we did let abdul take us up , thus obtaining a view of unprecedented magnificence which included not only remote and glittering cairo with its crowned citadel background of gold-violet hills , but all the pyramids of the memphian district as well , from abu roash on the north to the dashur on the south . the sakkara step-pyramid , which marks the evolution of the low mastaba into the true pyramid , showed clearly and alluringly in the sandy distance . it is close to this transition--monument that the famed tomb of perneb was found--more than four hundred miles north of the theban rock valley where tut-ankh-amen sleeps . again i was forced to silence through sheer awe . the prospect of such antiquity , and the secrets each hoary monument seemed to hold and brood over , filled me with a reverence and sense of immensity nothing else ever gave me .\\n\\nfatigued by our climb , and disgusted with the importunate bedouins whose actions seemed to defy every rule of taste , we omitted the arduous detail of entering the cramped interior passages of any of the pyramids , though we saw several of the hardiest tourists preparing for the suffocating crawl through cheops' mightiest memorial . as we dismissed and overpaid our local bodyguard and drove back to cairo with abdul reis under the afternoon sun , we half regretted the omission we had made . such fascinating things were whispered about lower pyramid passages not in the guidebooks ; passages whose entrances had been hastily blocked up and concealed by certain uncommunicative archaeologists who had found and begun to explore them .\\n\\nof course , this whispering was largely baseless on the face of it ; but it was curious to reflect how persistently visitors were forbidden to enter the pyramids at night , or to visit the lowest burrows and crypt of the great pyramid . perhaps in the latter case it was the psychological effect which was feared--the effect on the visitor of feeling himself huddled down beneath a gigantic world of solid masonry ; joined to the life he has known by the merest tube , in which he may only crawl , and which any accident or evil design might block . the whole subject seemed so weird and alluring that we resolved to pay the pyramid plateau another visit at the earliest possible opportunity . for me this opportunity came much earlier than i expected .\\n\\nthat evening , the members of our party feeling some what tired after the strenuous program of the day , i went alone with abdul reis for a walk through the picturesque arab quarter . though i had seen it by day , i wished to study the alleys and bazaars in the dusk , when rich shadows and mellow gleams of light would add to their glamor and fantastic illusion . the native crowds were thinning , but were still very noisy and numerous when we came upon a knot of reveling bedouins in the suken-nahhasin , or bazaar of the coppersmiths . their apparent leader , an insolent youth with heavy features and saucily cocked tarbush , took some notice of us , and evidently recognized with no great friendliness my competent but admittedly supercilious and sneeringly disposed guide .\\n\\nperhaps , i thought , he resented that odd reproduction of the sphinx's half-smile which i had often remarked with amused irritation ; or perhaps he did not like the hollow and sepulchral resonance of abdul's voice . at any rate , the exchange of ancestrally opprobrious language became very brisk ; and before long ali ziz , as i heard the stranger called when called by no worse name , began to pull violently at abdul's robe , an action quickly reciprocated and leading to a spirited scuffle in which both combatants lost their sacredly cherished headgear and would have reached an even direr condition had i not intervened and separated them by main force .\\n\\nmy interference , at first seemingly unwelcome on both sides , succeeded at last in effecting a truce . sullenly each belligerent composed his wrath and his attire , and with an assumption of dignity as profound as it was sudden , the two formed a curious pact of honor which i soon learned is a custom of great antiquity in cairo--a pact for the settlement of their difference by means of a nocturnal fist fight atop the great pyramid , long after the departure of the last moonlight sightseer . each duelist was to assemble a party of seconds , and the affair was to begin at midnight , proceeding by rounds in the most civilized possible fashion .\\n\\nin all this planning there was much which excited my interest . the fight itself promised to be unique and spectacular , while the thought of the scene on that hoary pile overlooking the antediluvian plateau of gizeh under the wan moon of the pallid small hours appealed to every fiber of imagination in me . a request found abdul exceedingly willing to admit me to his party of seconds ; so that all the rest of the early evening i accompanied him to various dens in the most lawless regions of the town--mostly northeast of the ezbekiyeh--where he gathered one by one a select and formidable band of congenial cutthroats as his pugilistic background .\\n\\nshortly after nine our party , mounted on donkeys bearing such royal or tourist-reminiscent names as 'rameses ,' 'mark twain ,' 'j . p . morgan ,' and 'minnehaha ,' edged through street labyrinths both oriental and occidental , crossed the muddy and mast-forested nile by the bridge of the bronze lions , and cantered philosophically between the lebbakhs on the road to gizeh . slightly over two hours were consumed by the trip , toward the end of which we passed the last of the returning tourists , saluted the last inbound trolley-car , and were alone with the night and the past and the spectral moon .\\n\\nthen we saw the vast pyramids at the end of the avenue , ghoulish with a dim atavistical menace which i had not seemed to notice in the daytime . even the smallest of them held a hint of the ghastly--for was it not in this that they had buried queen nitocris alive in the sixth dynasty ; subtle queen nitocris , who once invited all her enemies to a feast in a temple below the nile , and drowned them by opening the water-gates ? i recalled that the arabs whisper things about nitocris , and shun the third pyramid at certain phases of the moon . it must have been over her that thomas moore was brooding when he wrote a thing muttered about by memphian boatmen : 'the subterranean nymph that dwells 'mid sunless gems and glories hid--the lady of the pyramid !'\\n\\nearly as we were , ali ziz and his party were ahead of us ; for we saw their donkeys outlined against the desert plateau at kafrel-haram ; toward which squalid arab settlement , close to the sphinx , we had diverged instead of following the regular road to the mena house , where some of the sleepy , inefficient police might have observed and halted us . here , where filthy bedouins stabled camels and donkeys in the rock tombs of khephren's courtiers , we were led up the rocks and over the sand to the great pyramid , up whose time-worn sides the arabs swarmed eagerly , abdul reis offering me the assistance i did not need .\\n\\nas most travelers know , the actual apex of this structure has long been worn away , leaving a reasonably flat platform twelve yards square . on this eery pinnacle a squared circle was formed , and in a few moments the sardonic desert moon leered down upon a battle which , but for the quality of the ringside cries , might well have occurred at some minor athletic club in america . as i watched it , i felt that some of our less-desirable institutions were not lacking ; for every blow , feint , and defense bespoke 'stalling' to my not inexperienced eye . it was quickly over , and despite my misgivings as to methods i felt a sort of proprietary pride when abdul reis was adjudged the winner .\\n\\nreconciliation was phenomenally rapid , and amidst the singing , fraternizing and drinking that followed , i found it difficult to realize that a quarrel had ever occurred . oddly enough , i myself seemed to be more a center of notice than the antagonists ; and from my smattering of arabic i judged that they were discussing my professional performances and escapes from every sort of manacle and confinement , in a manner which indicated not only a surprising knowledge of me , but a distinct hostility and skepticism concerning my feats of escape . it gradually dawned on me that the elder magic of egypt did not depart without leaving traces , and that fragments of a strange secret lore and priestly cult-practices have survived surreptitiously amongst the fellaheen to such an extent that the prowess of a strange hahwi or magician is resented and disputed . i thought of how much my hollow-voiced guide abdul reis looked like an old egyptian priest or pharaoh or smiling sphinx . . .and wondered .\\n\\nsuddenly something happened which in a flash proved the correctness of my reflections and made me curse the denseness whereby i had accepted this night's events as other than the empty and malicious 'frame-up' they now showed themselves to be . without warning , and doubtless in answer to some subtle sign from abdul , the entire band of bedouins precipitated itself upon me ; and having produced heavy ropes , soon had me bound as securely as i was ever bound in the course of my life , either on the stage or off .\\n\\ni struggled at first , but soon saw that one man could make no headway against a band of over twenty sinewy barbarians . my hands were tied behind my back , my knees bent to their fullest extent , and my wrists and ankles stoutly linked together with unyielding cords . a stifling gag was forced into my mouth , and a blindfold fastened tightly over my eyes . then , as arabs bore me aloft on their shoulders and began a jouncing descent of the pyramid , i heard the taunts of my late guide abdul , who mocked and jeered delightedly in his hollow voice , and assured me that i was soon to have my 'magic-powers' put to a supreme test--which would quickly remove any egotism i might have gained through triumphing over all the tests offered by america and europe . egypt , he reminded me , is very old , and full of inner mysteries and antique powers not even conceivable to the experts of today , whose devices had so uniformly failed to entrap me .\\n\\nhow far or in what direction i was carried , i cannot tell ; for the circumstances were all against the formation of any accurate judgment . i know , however , that it could not have been a great distance ; since my bearers at no point hastened beyond a walk , yet kept me aloft a surprisingly short time . it is this perplexing brevity which makes me feel almost like shuddering whenever i think of gizeh and its plateau--for one is oppressed by hints of the closeness to everyday tourist routes of what existed then and must exist still .\\n\\nthe evil abnormality i speak of did not become manifest at first . setting me down on a surface which i recognized as sand rather than rock , my captors passed a rope around my chest and dragged me a few feet to a ragged opening in the ground , into which they presently lowered me with much rough handling . for apparent eons i bumped against the stony irregular sides of a narrow hewn well which i took to be one of the numerous burial-shafts of the plateau until the prodigious , almost incredible depth of it robbed me of all bases of conjecture .\\n\\nthe horror of the experience deepened with every dragging second . that any descent through the sheer solid rock could be so vast without reaching the core of the planet itself , or that any rope made by man could be so long as to dangle me in these unholy and seemingly fathomless profundities of nether earth , were beliefs of such grotesqueness that it was easier to doubt my agitated senses than to accept them . even now i am uncertain , for i know how deceitful the sense of time becomes when one is removed or distorted . but i am quite sure that i preserved a logical consciousness that far ; that at least i did not add any fullgrown phantoms of imagination to a picture hideous enough in its reality , and explicable by a type of cerebral illusion vastly short of actual hallucination .\\n\\nall this was not the cause of my first bit of fainting . the shocking ordeal was cumulative , and the beginning of the later terrors was a very perceptible increase in my rate of descent . they were paying out that infinitely long rope very swiftly now , and i scraped cruelly against the rough and constricted sides of the shaft as i shot madly downward . my clothing was in tatters , and i felt the trickle of blood all over , even above the mounting and excruciating pain . my nostrils , too , were assailed by a scarcely definable menace : a creeping odor of damp and staleness curiously unlike anything i had ever smelled before , and having faint overtones of spice and incense that lent an element of mockery .\\n\\nthen the mental cataclysm came . it was horrible--hideous beyond all articulate description because it was all of the soul , with nothing of detail to describe . it was the ecstasy of nightmare and the summation of the fiendish . the suddenness of it was apocalyptic and demoniac--one moment i was plunging agonizingly down that narrow well of million-toothed torture , yet the next moment i was soaring on bat--wings in the gulfs of hell ; swinging free and swooping through illimitable miles of boundless , musty space ; rising dizzily to measureless pinnacles of chilling ether , then diving gaspingly to sucking nadirs of ravenous , nauseous lower vacua . . .thank god for the mercy that shut out in oblivion those clawing furies of consciousness which half unhinged my faculties , and tore harpy-like at my spirit ! that one respite , short as it was , gave me the strength and sanity to endure those still greater sublimations of cosmic panic that lurked and gibbered on the road ahead . ii\\n\\nit was very gradually that i regained my senses after that eldritch flight through stygian space . the process was infinitely painful , and colored by fantastic dreams in which my bound and gagged condition found singular embodiment . the precise nature of these dreams was very clear while i was experiencing them , but became blurred in my recollection almost immediately afterward , and was soon reduced to the merest outline by the terrible events--real or imaginary--which followed . i dreamed that i was in the grasp of a great and horrible paw ; a yellow , hairy , five-clawed paw which had reached out of the earth to crush and engulf me . and when i stopped to reflect what the paw was , it seemed to me that it was egypt . in the dream i looked back at the events of the preceding weeks , and saw myself lured and enmeshed little by little , subtly and insidiously , by some hellish ghoul-spirit of the elder nile sorcery ; some spirit that was in egypt before ever man was , and that will be when man is no more .\\n\\ni saw the horror and unwholesome antiquity of egypt , and the grisly alliance it has always had with the tombs and temples of the dead . i saw phantom processions of priests with the heads of bulls , falcons , cats , and ibises ; phantom processions marching interminably through subterraneous labyrinths and avenues of titanic propylaea beside which a man is as a fly , and offering unnamable sacrifice to indescribable gods . stone colossi marched in endless night and drove herds of grinning androsphinxes down to the shores of illimitable stagnant rivers of pitch . and behind it all i saw the ineffable malignity of primordial necromancy , black and amorphous , and fumbling greedily after me in the darkness to choke out the spirit that had dared to mock it by emulation .\\n\\nin my sleeping brain there took shape a melodrama of sinister hatred and pursuit , and i saw the black soul of egypt singling me out and calling me in inaudible whispers ; calling and luring me , leading me on with the glitter and glamor of a saracenic surface , but ever pulling me down to the age-mad catacombs and horrors of its dead and abysmal pharaonic heart .\\n\\nthen the dream faces took on human resemblances , and i saw my guide abdul reis in the robes of a king , with the sneer of the sphinx on his features . and i knew that those features were the features of khephren the great , who raised the second pyramid , carved over the sphinx's face in the likeness of his own and built that titanic gateway temple whose myriad corridors the archaeologists think they have dug out of the cryptical sand and the uninformative rock . and i looked at the long , lean rigid hand of khephren ; the long , lean , rigid hand as i had seen it on the diorite statue in the cairo museum--the statue they had found in the terrible gateway temple--and wondered that i had not shrieked when i saw it on abdul reis . . .that hand ! it was hideously cold , and it was crushing me ; it was the cold and cramping of the sarcophagus the chill and constriction of unrememberable egypt . . .it was nighted , necropolitan egypt itself . . , that yellow paw . . and they whisper such things of khephren . . .\\n\\nbut at this juncture i began to wake--or at least , to assume a condition less completely that of sleep than the one just preceding . i recalled the fight atop the pyramid , the treacherous bedouins and their attack , my frightful descent by rope through endless rock depths , and my mad swinging and plunging in a chill void redolent of aromatic putrescence . i perceived that i now lay on a damp rock floor , and that my bonds were still biting into me with unloosened force . it was very cold , and i seemed to detect a faint current of noisome air sweeping across me . the cuts and bruises i had received from the jagged sides of the rock shaft were paining me woefully , their soreness enhanced to a stinging or burning acuteness by some pungent quality in the faint draft , and the mere act of rolling over was enough to set my whole frame throbbing with untold agony .\\n\\nas i turned i felt a tug from above , and concluded that the rope whereby i was lowered still reached to the surface . whether or not the arabs still held it , i had no idea ; nor had i any idea how far within the earth i was . i knew that the darkness around me was wholly or nearly total , since no ray of moonlight penetrated my blindfold ; but i did not trust my senses enough to accept as evidence of extreme depth the sensation of vast duration which had characterized my descent .\\n\\nknowing at least that i was in a space of considerable extent reached from the above surface directly by an opening in the rock , i doubtfully conjectured that my prison was perhaps the buried gateway chapel of old khephren--the temple of the sphinx--perhaps some inner corridors which the guides had not shown me during my morning visit , and from which i might easily escape if i could find my way to the barred entrance . it would be a labyrinthine wandering , but no worse than others out of which i had in the past found my way .\\n\\nthe first step was to get free of my bonds , gag , and blindfold ; and this i knew would be no great task , since subtler experts than these arabs had tried every known species of fetter upon me during my long and varied career as an exponent of escape , yet had never succeeded in defeating my methods .\\n\\nthen it occurred to me that the arabs might be ready to meet and attack me at the entrance upon any evidence of my probable escape from the binding cords , as would be furnished by any decided agitation of the rope which they probably held . this , of course , was taking for granted that my place of confinement was indeed khephren's temple of the sphinx . the direct opening in the roof , wherever it might lurk , could not be beyond easy reach of the ordinary modern entrance near the sphinx ; if in truth it were any great distance at all on the surface , since the total area known to visitors is not at all enormous . i had not noticed any such opening during my daytime pilgrimage , but knew that these things are easily overlooked amidst the drifting sands .\\n\\nthinking these matters over as i lay bent and bound on the rock floor , i nearly forgot the horrors of abysmal descent and cavernous swinging which had so lately reduced me to a coma . my present thought was only to outwit the arabs , and i accordingly determined to work myself free as quickly as possible , avoiding any tug on the descending line which might betray an effective or even problematical attempt at freedom .\\n\\nthis , however , was more easily determined than effected . a few preliminary trials made it clear that little could be accomplished without considerable motion ; and it did not surprise me when , after one especially energetic struggle , i began to feel the coils of falling rope as they piled up about me and upon me . obviously , i thought , the bedouins had felt my movements and released their end of the rope ; hastening no doubt to the temple's true entrance to lie murderously in wait for me .\\n\\nthe prospect was not pleasing--but i had faced worse in my time without flinching , and would not flinch now . at present i must first of all free myself of bonds , then trust to ingenuity to escape from the temple unharmed . it is curious how implicitly i had come to believe myself in the old temple of khephren beside the sphinx , only a short distance below the ground .\\n\\nthat belief was shattered , and every pristine apprehension of preternatural depth and demoniac mystery revived , by a circumstance which grew in horror and significance even as i formulated my philosophical plan . i have said that the falling rope was piling up about and upon me . now i saw that it was continuing to pile , as no rope of normal length could possibly do . it gained in momentum and became an avalanche of hemp , accumulating mountainously on the floor and half burying me beneath its swiftly multiplying coils . soon i was completely engulfed and gasping for breath as the increasing convolutions submerged and stifled me .\\n\\nmy senses tottered again , and i vaguely tried to fight off a menace desperate and ineluctable . it was not merely that i was tortured beyond human endurance--not merely that life and breath seemed to be crushed slowly out of me--it was the knowledge of what those unnatural lengths of rope implied , and the consciousness of what unknown and incalculable gulfs of inner earth must at this moment be surrounding me . my endless descent and swinging flight through goblin space , then , must have been real , and even now i must be lying helpless in some nameless cavern world toward the core of the planet . such a sudden confirmation of ultimate horror was insupportable , and a second time i lapsed into merciful oblivion .\\n\\nwhen i say oblivion , i do not imply that i was free from dreams . on the contrary , my absence from the conscious world was marked by visions of the most unutterable hideousness . god ! . . .if only i had not read so much egyptology before coming to this land which is the fountain of all darkness and terror ! this second spell of fainting filled my sleeping mind anew with shivering realization of the country and its archaic secrets , and through some damnable chance my dreams turned to the ancient notions of the dead and their sojournings in soul and body beyond those mysterious tombs which were more houses than graves . i recalled , in dream-shapes which it is well that i do not remember , the peculiar and elaborate construction of egyptian sepulchers ; and the exceedingly singular and terrific doctrines which determined this construction .\\n\\nall these people thought of was death and the dead . they conceived of a literal resurrection of the body which made them mummify it with desperate care , and preserve all the vital organs in canopic jars near the corpse ; whilst besides the body they believed in two other elements , the soul , which after its weighing and approval by osiris dwelt in the land of the blest , and the obscure and portentous ka or life-principle which wandered about the upper and lower worlds in a horrible way , demanding occasional access to the preserved body , consuming the food offerings brought by priests and pious relatives to the mortuary chapel , and sometimes--as men whispered--taking its body or the wooden double always buried beside it and stalking noxiously abroad on errands peculiarly repellent .\\n\\nfor thousands of years those bodies rested gorgeously encased and staring glassily upward when not visited by the ka , awaiting the day when osiris should restore both ka and soul , and lead forth the stiff legions of the dead from the sunken houses of sleep . it was to have been a glorious rebirth--but not all souls were approved , nor were all tombs inviolate , so that certain grotesque mistakes and fiendish abnormalities were to be looked for . even today the arabs murmur of unsanctified convocations and unwholesome worship in forgotten nether abysses , which only winged invisible kas and soulless mummies may visit and return unscathed .\\n\\nperhaps the most leeringly blood-congealing legends are those which relate to certain perverse products of decadent priestcraft--composite mummies made by the artificial union of human trunks and limbs with the heads of animals in imitation of the elder gods . at all stages of history the sacred animals were mummified , so that consecrated bulls , cats , ibises , crocodiles and the like might return some day to greater glory . but only in the decadence did they mix the human and the animal in the same mummy--only in the decadence , when they did not understand the rights and prerogatives of the ka and the soul .\\n\\nwhat happened to those composite mummies is not told of--at least publicly--and it is certain that no egyptologist ever found one . the whispers of arabs are very wild , and cannot be relied upon . they even hint that old khephren--he of the sphinx , the second pyramid and the yawning gateway temple--lives far underground wedded to the ghoul-queen nitocris and ruling over the mummies that are neither of man nor of beast .\\n\\nit was of these--of khephren and his consort and his strange armies of the hybrid dead--that i dreamed , and that is why i am glad the exact dream-shapes have faded from my memory . my most horrible vision was connected with an idle question i had asked myself the day before when looking at the great carven riddle of the desert and wondering with what unknown depth the temple close to it might be secretly connected . that question , so innocent and whimsical then , assumed in my dream a meaning of frenetic and hysterical madness . . .what huge and loathsome abnormality was the sphinx originally carven to represent ?\\n\\nmy second awakening--if awakening it was--is a memory of stark hideousness which nothing else in my life--save one thing which came after--can parallel ; and that life has been full and adventurous beyond most men's . remember that i had lost consciousness whilst buried beneath a cascade of falling rope whose immensity revealed the cataclysmic depth of my present position . now , as perception returned , i felt the entire weight gone ; and realized upon rolling over that although i was still tied , gagged and blindfolded , some agency had removed completely the suffocating hempen landslide which had overwhelmed me . the significance of this condition , of course , came to me only gradually ; but even so i think it would have brought unconsciousness again had i not by this time reached such a state of emotional exhaustion that no new horror could make much difference . i was alone . . .with what ?\\n\\nbefore i could torture myself with any new reflection , or make any fresh effort to escape from my bonds , an additional circumstance became manifest . pains not formerly felt were racking my arms and legs , and i seemed coated with a profusion of dried blood beyond anything my former cuts and abrasions could furnish . my chest , too , seemed pierced by a hundred wounds , as though some malign , titanic ibis had been pecking at it . assuredly the agency which had removed the rope was a hostile one , and had begun to wreak terrible injuries upon me when somehow impelled to desist . yet at the same time my sensations were distinctly the reverse of what one might expect . instead of sinking into a bottomless pit of despair , i was stirred to a new courage and action ; for now i felt that the evil forces were physical things which a fearless man might encounter on an even basis .\\n\\non the strength of this thought i tugged again at my bonds , and used all the art of a lifetime to free myself as i had so often done amidst the glare of lights and the applause of vast crowds . the familiar details of my escaping process commenced to engross me , and now that the long rope was gone i half regained my belief that the supreme horrors were hallucinations after all , and that there had never been any terrible shaft , measureless abyss or interminable rope . was i after all in the gateway temple of khephren beside the sphinx , and had the sneaking arabs stolen in to torture me as i lay helpless there ? at any rate , i must be free . let me stand up unbound , ungagged , and with eyes open to catch any glimmer of light which might come trickling from any source , and i could actually delight in the combat against evil and treacherous foes !\\n\\nhow long i took in shaking off my encumbrances i cannot tell . it must have been longer than in my exhibition performances , because i was wounded , exhausted , and enervated by the experiences i had passed through . when i was finally free , and taking deep breaths of a chill , damp , evilly spiced air all the more horrible when encountered without the screen of gag and blindfold edges , i found that i was too cramped and fatigued to move at once . there i lay , trying to stretch a frame bent and mangled , for an indefinite period , and straining my eyes to catch a glimpse of some ray of light which would give a hint as to my position .\\n\\nby degrees my strength and flexibility returned , but my eyes beheld nothing . as i staggered to my feet i peered diligently in every direction , yet met only an ebony blackness as great as that i had known when blindfolded . i tried my legs , blood-encrusted beneath my shredded trousers , and found that i could walk ; yet could not decide in what direction to go . obviously i ought not to walk at random , and perhaps retreat directly from the entrance i sought ; so i paused to note the difference of the cold , fetid , natron-scented air-current which i had never ceased to feel . accepting the point of its source as the possible entrance to the abyss , i strove to keep track of this landmark and to walk consistently toward it .\\n\\ni had a match-box with me , and even a small electric flashlight ; but of course the pockets of my tossed and tattered clothing were long since emptied of all heavy articles . as i walked cautiously in the blackness , the draft grew stronger and more offensive , till at length i could regard it as nothing less than a tangible stream of detestable vapor pouring out of some aperture like the smoke of the genie from the fisherman's jar in the eastern tale . the east . . .egypt . . .truly , this dark cradle of civilization was ever the wellspring of horrors and marvels unspeakable !\\n\\nthe more i reflected on the nature of this cavern wind , the greater my sense of disquiet became ; for although despite its odor i had sought its source as at least an indirect clue to the outer world , i now saw plainly that this foul emanation could have no admixture or connection whatsoever with the clean air of the libyan desert , but must be essentially a thing vomited from sinister gulfs still lower down . i had , then , been walking in the wrong direction !\\n\\nafter a moment's reflection i decided not to retrace my steps . away from the draft i would have no landmarks , for the roughly level rock floor was devoid of distinctive configurations . if , however , i followed up the strange current , i would undoubtedly arrive at an aperture of some sort , from whose gate i could perhaps work round the walls to the opposite side of this cyclopean and otherwise unnavigable hall . that i might fail , i well realized . i saw that this was no part of khephren's gateway temple which tourists know , and it struck me that this particular hall might be unknown even to archaeologists , and merely stumbled upon by the inquisitive and malignant arabs who had imprisoned me . if so , was there any present gate of escape to the known parts or to the outer air ?\\n\\nwhat evidence , indeed , did i now possess that this was the gateway temple at all ? for a moment all my wildest speculations rushed back upon me , 'and i thought of that vivid melange of impressions--descent , suspension in space , the rope , my wounds , and the dreams that were frankly dreams . was this the end of life for me ? or indeed , would it be merciful if this moment were the end ? i could answer none of my own questions , but merely kept on , till fate for a third time reduced me to oblivion .\\n\\nthis time there were no dreams , for the suddenness of the incident shocked me out of all thought either conscious or subconscious . tripping on an unexpected descending step at a point where the offensive draft became strong enough to offer an actual physical resistance , i was precipitated headlong down a black flight of huge stone stairs into a gulf of hideousness unrelieved .\\n\\nthat i ever breathed again is a tribute to the inherent vitality of the healthy human organism . often i look back to that night and feel a touch of actual humor in those repeated lapses of consciousness ; lapses whose succession reminded me at the time of nothing more than the crude cinema melodramas of that period . of course , it is possible that the repeated lapses never occurred ; and that all the features of that underground nightmare were merely the dreams of one long coma which began with the shock of my descent into that abyss and ended with the healing balm of the outer air and of the rising sun which found me stretched on the sands of gizeh before the sardonic and dawn--flushed face of the great sphinx .\\n\\ni prefer to believe this latter explanation as much as i can , hence was glad when the police told me that the barrier to krephren's gateway temple had been found unfastened , and that a sizeable rift to the surface did actually exist in one corner of the still buried part . i was glad , too , when the doctors pronounced my wounds only those to be expected from my seizure , blindfolding , lowering , struggling with bonds , falling some distance--perhaps into a depression in the temple's inner gallery--dragging myself to the outer barrier and escaping from it , and experiences like that . . , a very soothing diagnosis . and yet i know that there must be more than appears on the surface . that extreme descent is too vivid a memory to be dismissed--and it is odd that no one has ever been able to find a man answering the description of my guide , abdul reis el drogman--the tomb-throated guide who looked and smiled like king khephren .\\n\\ni have digressed from my connected narrative--perhaps in the vain hope of evading the telling of that final incident ; that incident which of all is most certainly an hallucination . but i promised to relate it , and i do not break promises . when i recovered--or seemed to recover--my senses after that fall down the black stone stairs , i was quite as alone and in darkness as before . the windy stench , bad enough before , was now fiendish ; yet i had acquired enough familiarity by this time to bear it stoically . dazedly i began to crawl away from the place whence the putrid wind came , and with my bleeding hands felt the colossal blocks of a mighty pavement . once my head struck against a hard object , and when i felt of it i learned that it was the base of a column--a column of unbelievable immensity--whose surface was covered with gigantic chiseled hieroglyphics very perceptible to my touch .\\n\\ncrawling on , i encountered other titan columns at incomprehensible distances apart ; when suddenly my attention was captured by the realization of something which must have been impinging on my subconscious hearing long before the conscious sense was aware of it .\\n\\nfrom some still lower chasm in earth's bowels were proceeding certain sounds , measured and definite , and like nothing i had ever heard before . that they were very ancient and distinctly ceremonial i felt almost intuitively ; and much reading in egyptology led me to associate them with the flute , the sambuke , the sistrum , and the tympanum . in their rhythmic piping , droning , rattling and beating i felt an element of terror beyond all the known terrors of earth--a terror peculiarly dissociated from personal fear , and taking the form of a sort of objective pity for our planet , that it should hold within its depths such horrors as must lie beyond these aegipanic cacophonies . the sounds increased in volume , and i felt that they were approaching . then--and may all the gods of all pantheons unite to keep the like from my ears again--i began to hear , faintly and afar off , the morbid and millennial tramping of the marching things .\\n\\nit was hideous that footfalls so dissimilar should move in such perfect rhythm . the training of unhallowed thousands of years must lie behind that march of earth's inmost monstrosities . . .padding , clicking , walking , stalking , rumbling , lumbering , crawling . . .and all to the abhorrent discords of those mocking instruments . and then--god keep the memory of those arab legends out of my head !--the mummies without souls . . .the meeting-place of the wandering kas . . . .the hordes of the devil-cursed pharaonic dead of forty centuries . . .the composite mummies led through the uttermost onyx voids by king khephren and his ghoul--queen nitocris . .\\n\\nthe tramping drew nearer--heaven save me from the sound of those feet and paws and hooves and pads and talons as it commenced to acquire detail ! down limitless reaches of sunless pavement a spark of light flickered in the malodorous wind and i drew behind the enormous circumference of a cyclopic column that i might escape for a while the horror that was stalking million-footed toward me through gigantic hypostyles of inhuman dread and phobic antiquity . the flickers increased , and the tramping and dissonant rhythm grew sickeningly loud . in the quivering orange light there stood faintly forth a scene of such stony awe that i gasped from sheer wonder that conquered even fear and repulsion . bases of columns whose middles were higher than human sight , mere bases of things that must each dwarf the eiffel tower to insignificance . . .hieroglyphics carved by unthinkable hands in caverns where daylight can be only a remote legend . . .\\n\\ni would not look at the marching things . that i desperately resolved as i heard their creaking joints and nitrous wheezing above the dead music and the dead tramping . it was merciful that they did not speak . . .but god ! their crazy torches began to cast shadows on the surface of those stupendous columns . hippopotami should not have human hands and carry torches . . .men should not have the heads of crocodiles . . .\\n\\ni tried to turn away , but the shadows and the sounds and the stench were everywhere . then i remembered something i used to do in half--conscious nightmares as a boy , and began to repeat to myself , 'this is a dream ! this is a dream !' but it was of no use , and i could only shut my eyes and pray . . .at least , that is what i think i did , for one is never sure in visions--and i know this can have been nothing more . i wondered whether i should ever reach the world again , and at times would furtively open my eyes to see if i could discern any feature of the place other than the wind of spiced putrefaction , the topless columns , and the thaumatropically grotesque shadows of abnormal horror . the sputtering glare of multiplying torches now shone , and unless this hellish place were wholly without walls , i could not fail to see some boundary or fixed landmark soon . but i had to shut my eyes again when i realized how many of the things were assembling--and when i glimpsed a certain object walking solemnly and steadily without any body above the waist .\\n\\na fiendish and ululant corpse-gurgle or death-rattle now split the very atmosphere--the charnel atmosphere poisonous with naftha and bitumen blasts--in one concerted chorus from the ghoulish legion of hybrid blasphemies . my eyes , perversely shaken open , gazed for an instant upon a sight which no human creature could even imagine without panic , fear and physical exhaustion . the things had filed ceremonially in one direction , the direction of the noisome wind , where the light of their torches showed their bended heads--or the bended heads of such as had heads . they were worshipping before a great black fetor-belching aperture which reached up almost out of sight , and which i could see was flanked at right angles by two giant staircases whose ends were far away in shadow . one of these was indubitably the staircase i had fallen down .\\n\\nthe dimensions of the hole were fully in proportion with those of the columns--an ordinary house would have been lost in it , and any average public building could easily have been moved in and out . it was so vast a surface that only by moving the eye could one trace its boundaries . . .so vast , so hideously black , and so aromatically stinking . directly in front of this yawning polyphemus-door the things were throwing objects--evidently sacrifices or religious offerings , to judge by their gestures . khephren was their leader ; sneering king khephren or the guide abdul reis , crowned with a golden pshent and intoning endless formulae with the hollow voice of the dead . by his side knelt beautiful queen nitocris , whom i saw in profile for a moment , noting that the right half of her face was eaten away by rats or other ghouls . and i shut my eyes again when i saw what objects were being thrown as offerings to the fetid aperture or its possible local deity .\\n\\nit occurred to me that , judging from the elaborateness of this worship , the concealed deity must be one of considerable importance . was it osiris or isis , horus or anubis , or some vast unknown god of the dead still more central and supreme ? there is a legend that terrible altars and colossi were reared to an unknown one before ever the known gods were worshipped . . .\\n\\nand now , as i steeled myself to watch the rapt and sepulchral adorations of those nameless things , a thought of escape flashed upon me . the hall was dim , and the columns heavy with shadow . with every creature of that nightmare throng absorbed in shocking raptures , it might be barely possible for me to creep past to the far-away end of one of the staircases and ascend unseen ; trusting to fate and skill to deliver me from the upper reaches . where i was , i neither knew nor seriously reflected upon--and for a moment it struck me as amusing to plan a serious escape from that which i knew to be a dream . was i in some hidden and unsuspected lower realm of khephren's gateway temple--that temple which generations have persistently called the temple of the sphinx ? i could not conjecture , but i resolved to ascend to life and consciousness if wit and muscle could carry me .\\n\\nwriggling flat on my stomach , i began the anxious journey toward the foot of the left-hand staircase , which seemed the more accessible of the two . i cannot describe the incidents and sensations of that crawl , but they may be guessed when one reflects on what i had to watch steadily in that malign , wind-blown torchlight in order to avoid detection . the bottom of the staircase was , as i have said , far away in shadow , as it had to be to rise without a bend to the dizzy parapeted landing above the titanic aperture . this placed the last stages of my crawl at some distance from the noisome herd , though the spectacle chilled me even when quite remote at my right .\\n\\nat length i succeeded in reaching the steps and began to climb ; keeping close to the wall , on which i observed decorations of the most hideous sort , and relying for safety on the absorbed , ecstatic interest with which the monstrosities watched the foul-breezed aperture and the impious objects of nourishment they had flung on the pavement before it . though the staircase was huge and steep , fashioned of vast porphyry blocks as if for the feet of a giant , the ascent seemed virtually interminable . dread of discovery and the pain which renewed exercise had brought to my wounds combined to make that upward crawl a thing of agonizing memory . i had intended , on reaching the landing , to climb immediately onward along whatever upper staircase might mount from there ; stopping for no last look at the carrion abominations that pawed and genuflected some seventy or eighty feet below--yet a sudden repetition of that thunderous corpse-gurgle and death-rattle chorus , coming as i had nearly gained the top of the flight and showing by its ceremonial rhythm that it was not an alarm of my discovery , caused me to pause and peer cautiously over the parapet .\\n\\nthe monstrosities were hailing something which had poked itself out of the nauseous aperture to seize the hellish fare proffered it . it was something quite ponderous , even as seen from my height ; something yellowish and hairy , and endowed with a sort of nervous motion . it was as large , perhaps , as a good-sized hippopotamus , but very curiously shaped . it seemed to have no neck , but five separate shaggy heads springing in a row from a roughly cylindrical trunk ; the first very small , the second good-sized , the third and fourth equal and largest of all , and the fifth rather small , though not so small as the first .\\n\\nout of these heads darted curious rigid tentacles which seized ravenously on the excessively great quantities of unmentionable food placed before the aperture . once in a while the thing would leap up , and occasionally it would retreat into its den in a very odd manner . its locomotion was so inexplicable that i stared in fascination , wishing it would emerge farther from the cavernous lair beneath me .\\n\\nthen it did emerge . . .it did emerge , and at the sight i turned and fled into the darkness up the higher staircase that rose behind me ; fled unknowingly up incredible steps and ladders and inclined planes to which no human sight or logic guided me , and which i must ever relegate to the world of dreams for want of any confirmation . it must have been a dream , or the dawn would never have found me breathing on the sands of gizeh before the sardonic dawn-flushed face of the great sphinx .\\n\\nthe great sphinx ! god !--that idle question i asked myself on that sun--blest morning before . . .what huge and loathsome abnormality was the sphinx originally carven to represent ?\\n\\naccursed is the sight , be it in dream or not , that revealed to me the supreme horror--the unknown god of the dead , which licks its colossal chops in the unsuspected abyss , fed hideous morsels by soulless absurdities that should not exist . the five-headed monster that emerged . . .that five-headed monster as large as a hippopotamus . . .the five headed monster--and that of which it is the merest forepaw . . .\\n\\nbut i survived , and i know it was only a dream .\\n\", shape=(),

            "tf.Tensor(b'the dream quest of unknown kadath\\n\\nthree times randolph carter dreamed of the marvelous city , and three times was he snatched away while still he paused on the high terrace above it . all golden and lovely it blazed in the sunset , with walls , temples , colonnades and arched bridges of veined marble , silver--basined fountains of prismatic spray in broad squares and perfumed gardens , and wide streets marching between delicate trees and blossom--laden urns and ivory statues in gleaming rows ; while on steep northward slopes climbed tiers of red roofs and old peaked gables harbouring little lanes of grassy cobbles . it was a fever of the gods , a fanfare of supernal trumpets and a clash of immortal cymbals . mystery hung about it as clouds about a fabulous unvisited mountain ; and as carter stood breathless and expectant on that balustraded parapet there swept up to him the poignancy and suspense of almost--vanished memory , the pain of lost things and the maddening need to place again what once had been an awesome and momentous place .\\n\\nhe knew that for him its meaning must once have been supreme ; though in what cycle or incarnation he had known it , or whether in dream or in waking , he could not tell . vaguely it called up glimpses of a far forgotten first youth , when wonder and pleasure lay in all the mystery of days , and dawn and dusk alike strode forth prophetic to the eager sound of lutes and song , unclosing fiery gates toward further and surprising marvels . but each night as he stood on that high marble terrace with the curious urns and carven rail and looked off over that hushed sunset city of beauty and unearthly immanence he felt the bondage of dream\\'s tyrannous gods ; for in no wise could he leave that lofty spot , or descend the wide marmoreal fights flung endlessly down to where those streets of elder witchery lay outspread and beckoning .\\n\\nwhen for the third time he awakened with those flights still undescended and those hushed sunset streets still untraversed , he prayed long and earnestly to the hidden gods of dream that brood capricious above the clouds on unknown kadath , in the cold waste where no man treads . but the gods made no answer and shewed no relenting , nor did they give any favouring sign when he prayed to them in dream , and invoked them sacrificially through the bearded priests of nasht and kaman-thah , whose cavern-temple with its pillar of flame lies not far from the gates of the waking world . it seemed , however , that his prayers must have been adversely heard , for after even the first of them he ceased wholly to behold the marvellous city ; as if his three glimpses from afar had been mere accidents or oversights , and against some hidden plan or wish of the gods .\\n\\nat length , sick with longing for those glittering sunset streets and cryptical hill lanes among ancient tiled roofs , nor able sleeping or waking to drive them from his mind , carter resolved to go with bold entreaty whither no man had gone before , and dare the icy deserts through the dark to where unknown kadath , veiled in cloud and crowned with unimagined stars , holds secret and nocturnal the onyx castle of the great ones .\\n\\nin light slumber he descended the seventy steps to the cavern of flame and talked of this design to the bearded priests nasht and kaman-thah . and the priests shook their pshent-bearing heads and vowed it would be the death of his soul . they pointed out that the great ones had shown already their wish , and that it is not agreeable to them to be harassed by insistent pleas . they reminded him , too , that not only had no man ever been to kadath , but no man had ever suspected in what part of space it may lie ; whether it be in the dreamlands around our own world , or in those surrounding some unguessed companion of fomalhaut or aldebaran . if in our dreamland , it might conceivably be reached , but only three human souls since time began had ever crossed and recrossed the black impious gulfs to other dreamlands , and of that three , two had come back quite mad . there were , in such voyages , incalculable local dangers ; as well as that shocking final peril which gibbers unmentionably outside the ordered universe , where no dreams reach ; that last amorphous blight of nethermost confusion which blasphemes and bubbles at the centre of all infinity--the boundless daemon sultan azathoth , whose name no lips dare speak aloud , and who gnaws hungrily in inconceivable , unlighted chambers beyond time amidst the muffled , maddening beating of vile drums and the thin , monotonous whine of accursed flutes ; to which detestable pounding and piping dance slowly , awkwardly , and absurdly the gigantic ultimate gods , the blind , voiceless , tenebrous , mindless other gods whose soul and messenger is the crawling chaos nyarlathotep .\\n\\nof these things was carter warned by the priests nasht and kaman-thah in the cavern of flame , but still he resolved to find the gods on unknown kadath in the cold waste , wherever that might be , and to win from them the sight and remembrance and shelter of the marvellous sunset city . he knew that his journey would be strange and long , and that the great ones would be against it ; but being old in the land of dream he counted on many useful memories and devices to aid him . so asking a formal blessing of the priests and thinking shrewdly on his course , he boldly descended the seven hundred steps to the gate of deeper slumber and set out through the enchanted wood .\\n\\nin the tunnels of that twisted wood , whose low prodigious oaks twine groping boughs and shine dim with the phosphorescence of strange fungi , dwell the furtive and secretive zoogs ; who know many obscure secrets of the dream world and a few of the waking world , since the wood at two places touches the lands of men , though it would be disastrous to say where . certain unexplained rumours , events , and vanishments occur among men where the zoogs have access , and it is well that they cannot travel far outside the world of dreams . but over the nearer parts of the dream world they pass freely , flitting small and brown and unseen and bearing back piquant tales to beguile the hours around their hearths in the forest they love . most of them live in burrows , but some inhabit the trunks of the great trees ; and although they live mostly on fungi it is muttered that they have also a slight taste for meat , either physical or spiritual , for certainly many dreamers have entered that wood who have not come out . carter , however , had no fear ; for he was an old dreamer and had learnt their fluttering language and made many a treaty with them ; having found through their help the splendid city of celephais in ooth-nargai beyond the tanarian hills , where reigns half the year the great king kuranes , a man he had known by another name in life . kuranes was the one soul who had been to the star-gulls and returned free from madness .\\n\\nthreading now the low phosphorescent aisles between those gigantic trunks , carter made fluttering sounds in the manner of the zoogs , and listened now and then for responses . he remembered one particular village of the creatures was in the centre of the wood , where a circle of great mossy stones in what was once a cleaning tells of older and more terrible dwellers long forgotten , and toward this spot he hastened . he traced his way by the grotesque fungi , which always seem better nourished as one approaches the dread circle where elder beings danced and sacrificed . finally the great light of those thicker fungi revealed a sinister green and grey vastness pushing up through the roof of the forest and out of sight . this was the nearest of the great ring of stones , and carter knew he was close to the zoog village . renewing his fluttering sound , he waited patiently ; and was at last rewarded by an impression of many eyes watching him . it was the zoogs , for one sees their weird eyes long before one can discern their small , slippery brown outlines .\\n\\nout they swarmed , from hidden burrow and honeycombed tree , till the whole dim-litten region was alive with them . some of the wilder ones brushed carter unpleasantly , and one even nipped loathsomely at his ear ; but these lawless spirits were soon restrained by their elders . the council of sages , recognizing the visitor , offered a gourd of fermented sap from a haunted tree unlike the others , which had grown from a seed dropt down by someone on the moon ; and as carter drank it ceremoniously a very strange colloquy began . the zoogs did not , unfortunately , know where the peak of kadath lies , nor could they even say whether the cold waste is in our dream world or in another . rumours of the great ones came equally from all points ; and one might only say that they were likelier to be seen on high mountain peaks than in valleys , since on such peaks they dance reminiscently when the moon is above and the clouds beneath .\\n\\nthen one very ancient zoog recalled a thing unheard-of by the others ; and said that in ulthar , beyond the river skai , there still lingered the last copy of those inconceivably old pnakotic manuscripts made by waking men in forgotten boreal kingdoms and borne into the land of dreams when the hairy cannibal gnophkehs overcame many-templed olathoe and slew all the heroes of the land of lomar . those manuscripts he said , told much of the gods , and besides , in ulthar there were men who had seen the signs of the gods , and even one old priest who had scaled a great mountain to behold them dancing by moonlight . he had failed , though his companion had succeeded and perished namelessly .\\n\\nso randolph carter thanked the zoogs , who fluttered amicably and gave him another gourd of moon-tree wine to take with him , and set out through the phosphorescent wood for the other side , where the rushing skai flows down from the slopes of lerion , and hatheg and nir and ulthar dot the plain . behind him , furtive and unseen , crept several of the curious zoogs ; for they wished to learn what might befall him , and bear back the legend to their people . the vast oaks grew thicker as he pushed on beyond the village , and he looked sharply for a certain spot where they would thin somewhat , standing quite dead or dying among the unnaturally dense fungi and the rotting mould and mushy logs of their fallen brothers . there he would turn sharply aside , for at that spot a mighty slab of stone rests on the forest floor ; and those who have dared approach it say that it bears an iron ring three feet wide . remembering the archaic circle of great mossy rocks , and what it was possibly set up for , the zoogs do not pause near that expansive slab with its huge ring ; for they realise that all which is forgotten need not necessarily be dead , and they would not like to see the slab rise slowly and deliberately .\\n\\ncarter detoured at the proper place , and heard behind him the frightened fluttering of some of the more timid zoogs . he had known they would follow him , so he was not disturbed ; for one grows accustomed to the anomalies of these prying creatures . it was twilight when he came to the edge of the wood , and the strengthening glow told him it was the twilight of morning . over fertile plains rolling down to the skai he saw the smoke of cottage chimneys , and on every hand were the hedges and ploughed fields and thatched roofs of a peaceful land . once he stopped at a farmhouse well for a cup of water , and all the dogs barked affrightedly at the inconspicuous zoogs that crept through the grass behind . at another house , where people were stirring , he asked questions about the gods , and whether they danced often upon lerion ; but the farmer and his wife would only make the elder sign and tell him the way to nir and ulthar .\\n\\nat noon he walked through the one broad high street of nir , which he had once visited and which marked his farthest former travels in this direction ; and soon afterward he came to the great stone bridge across the skai , into whose central piece the masons had sealed a living human sacrifice when they built it thirteen-hundred years before . once on the other side , the frequent presence of cats (who all arched their backs at the trailing zoogs) revealed the near neighborhood of ulthar ; for in ulthar , according to an ancient and significant law , no man may kill a cat . very pleasant were the suburbs of ulthar , with their little green cottages and neatly fenced farms ; and still pleasanter was the quaint town itself , with its old peaked roofs and overhanging upper stories and numberless chimney-pots and narrow hill streets where one can see old cobbles whenever the graceful cats afford space enough . carter , the cats being somewhat dispersed by the half-seen zoogs , picked his way directly to the modest temple of the elder ones where the priests and old records were said to be ; and once within that venerable circular tower of ivied stone--which crowns ulthar\\'s highest hill--he sought out the patriarch atal , who had been up the forbidden peak hatheg-kia in the stony desert and had come down again alive .\\n\\natal , seated on an ivory dais in a festooned shrine at the top of the temple , was fully three centuries old ; but still very keen of mind and memory . from him carter learned many things about the gods , but mainly that they are indeed only earth\\'s gods , ruling feebly our own dreamland and having no power or habitation elsewhere . they might , atal said , heed a man\\'s prayer if in good humour ; but one must not think of climbing to their onyx stronghold atop kadath in the cold waste . it was lucky that no man knew where kadath towers , for the fruits of ascending it would be very grave . atal\\'s companion banni the wise had been drawn screaming into the sky for climbing merely the known peak of hatheg-kia . with unknown kadath , if ever found , matters would be much worse ; for although earth\\'s gods may sometimes be surpassed by a wise mortal , they are protected by the other gods from outside , whom it is better not to discuss . at least twice in the world\\'s history the other gods set their seal upon earth\\'s primal granite ; once in antediluvian times , as guessed from a drawing in those parts of the pnakotic manuscripts too ancient to be read , and once on hatheg-kia when barzai the wise tried to see earth\\'s gods dancing by moonlight . so , atal said , it would be much better to let all gods alone except in tactful prayers .\\n\\ncarter , though disappointed by atal\\'s discouraging advice and by the meagre help to be found in the pnakotic manuscripts and the seven cryptical books of hsan , did not wholly despair . first he questioned the old priest about that marvellous sunset city seen from the railed terrace , thinking that perhaps he might find it without the gods\\' aid ; but atal could tell him nothing . probably , atal said , the place belonged to his especial dream world and not to the general land of vision that many know ; and conceivably it might be on another planet . in that case earth\\'s gods could not guide him if they would . but this was not likely , since the stopping of the dreams shewed pretty clearly that it was something the great ones wished to hide from him .\\n\\nthen carter did a wicked thing , offering his guileless host so many draughts of the moon-wine which the zoogs had given him that the old man became irresponsibly talkative . robbed of his reserve , poor atal babbled freely of forbidden things ; telling of a great image reported by travellers as carved on the solid rock of the mountain ngranek , on the isle of oriab in the southern sea , and hinting that it may be a likeness which earth\\'s gods once wrought of their own features in the days when they danced by moonlight on that mountain . and he hiccoughed likewise that the features of that image are very strange , so that one might easily recognize them , and that they are sure signs of the authentic race of the gods .\\n\\nnow the use of all this in finding the gods became at once apparent to carter . it is known that in disguise the younger among the great ones often espouse the daughters of men , so that around the borders of the cold waste wherein stands kadath the peasants must all bear their blood . this being so , the way to find that waste must be to see the stone face on ngranek and mark the features ; then , having noted them with care , to search for such features among living men . where they are plainest and thickest , there must the gods dwell nearest ; and whatever stony waste lies back of the villages in that place must be that wherein stands kadath .\\n\\nmuch of the great ones might be learnt in such regions , and those with their blood might inherit little memories very useful to a seeker . they might not know their parentage , for the gods so dislike to be known among men that none can be found who has seen their faces wittingly ; a thing which carter realized even as he sought to scale kadath . but they would have queer lofty thoughts misunderstood by their fellows , and would sing of far places and gardens so unlike any known even in the dreamland that common folk would call them fools ; and from all this one could perhaps learn old secrets of kadath , or gain hints of the marvellous sunset city which the gods held secret . and more , one might in certain cases seize some well-loved child of a god as hostage ; or even capture some young god himself , disguised and dwelling amongst men with a comely peasant maiden as his bride .\\n\\natal , however , did not know how to find ngranek on its isle of oriab ; and recommended that carter follow the singing skai under its bridges down to the southern sea ; where no burgess of ulthar has ever been , but whence the merchants come in boats or with long caravans of mules and two-wheeled carts . there is a great city there , dylath-leen , but in ulthar its reputation is bad because of the black three-banked galleys that sail to it with rubies from no clearly named shore . the traders that come from those galleys to deal with the jewellers are human , or nearly so , but the rowers are never beheld ; and it is not thought wholesome in ulthar that merchants should trade with black ships from unknown places whose rowers cannot be exhibited .\\n\\nby the time he had given this information atal was very drowsy , and carter laid him gently on a couch of inlaid ebony and gathered his long beard decorously on his chest . as he turned to go , he observed that no suppressed fluttering followed him , and wondered why the zoogs had become so lax in their curious pursuit . then he noticed all the sleek complacent cats of ulthar licking their chops with unusual gusto , and recalled the spitting and caterwauling he had faintly heard , in lower parts of the temple while absorbed in the old priest\\'s conversation . he recalled , too , the evilly hungry way in which an especially impudent young zoog had regarded a small black kitten in the cobbled street outside . and because he loved nothing on earth more than small black kittens , he stooped and petted the sleek cats of ulthar as they licked their chops , and did not mourn because those inquisitive zoogs would escort him no farther .\\n\\nit was sunset now , so carter stopped at an ancient inn on a steep little street overlooking the lower town . and as he went out on the balcony of his room and gazed down at the sea of red tiled roofs and cobbled ways and the pleasant fields beyond , all mellow and magical in the slanted light , he swore that ulthar would be a very likely place to dwell in always , were not the memory of a greater sunset city ever goading one onward toward unknown perils . then twilight fell , and the pink walls of the plastered gables turned violet and mystic , and little yellow lights floated up one by one from old lattice windows . and sweet bells pealed in the temple tower above , and the first star winked softly above the meadows across the skai . with the night came song , and carter nodded as the lutanists praised ancient days from beyond the filigreed balconies and tesselated courts of simple ulthar . and there might have been sweetness even in the voices of ulthar\\'s many cats , but that they were mostly heavy and silent from strange feasting . some of them stole off to those cryptical realms which are known only to cats and which villagers say are on the moon\\'s dark side , whither the cats leap from tall housetops , but one small black kitten crept upstairs and sprang in carter\\'s lap to purr and play , and curled up near his feet when he lay down at last on the little couch whose pillows were stuffed with fragrant , drowsy herbs .\\n\\nin the morning carter joined a caravan of merchants bound for dylath--leen with the spun wool of ulthar and the cabbages of ulthar\\'s busy farms . and for six days they rode with tinkling bells on the smooth road beside the skai ; stopping some nights at the inns of little quaint fishing towns , and on other nights camping under the stars while snatches of boatmen\\'s songs came from the placid river . the country was very beautiful , with green hedges and groves and picturesque peaked cottages and octagonal windmills .\\n\\non the seventh day a blur of smoke rose on the horizon ahead , and then the tall black towers of dylath-leen , which is built mostly of basalt . dylath-leen with its thin angular towers looks in the distance like a bit of the giant\\'s causeway , and its streets are dark and uninviting . there are many dismal sea-taverns near the myriad wharves , and all the town is thronged with the strange seamen of every land on earth and of a few which are said to be not on earth . carter questioned the oddly robed men of that city about the peak of ngranek on the isle of oriab , and found that they knew of it well .\\n\\nships came from baharna on that island , one being due to return thither in only a month , and ngranek is but two days\\' zebra-ride from that port . but few had seen the stone face of the god , because it is on a very difficult side of ngranek , which overlooks only sheer crags and a valley of sinister lava . once the gods were angered with men on that side , and spoke of the matter to the other gods .\\n\\nit was hard to get this information from the traders and sailors in dylath-leen\\'s sea taverns , because they mostly preferred to whisper of the black galleys . one of them was due in a week with rubies from its unknown shore , and the townsfolk dreaded to see it dock . the mouths of the men who came from it to trade were too wide , and the way their turbans were humped up in two points above their foreheads was in especially bad taste . and their shoes were the shortest and queerest ever seen in the six kingdoms . but worst of all was the matter of the unseen rowers . those three banks of oars moved too briskly and accurately and vigorously to be comfortable , and it was not right for a ship to stay in port for weeks while the merchants traded , yet to give no glimpse of its crew . it was not fair to the tavern-keepers of dylath-leen , or to the grocers and butchers , either ; for not a scrap of provisions was ever sent aboard . the merchants took only gold and stout black slaves from parg across the river . that was all they ever took , those unpleasantly featured merchants and their unseen rowers ; never anything from the butchers and grocers , but only gold and the fat black men of parg whom they bought by the pound . and the odours from those galleys which the south wind blew in from the wharves are not to be described . only by constantly smoking strong thagweed could even the hardiest denizen of the old sea-taverns bear them . dylath--leen would never have tolerated the black galleys had such rubies been obtainable elsewhere , but no mine in all barth\\'s dreamland was known to produce their like .\\n\\nof these things dylath-leen\\'s cosmopolitan folk chiefly gossiped whilst carter waited patiently for the ship from baharna , which might bear him to the isle whereon carven ngranek towers lofty and barren . meanwhile he did not fall to seek through the haunts of far travellers for any tales they might have concerning kadath in the cold waste or a marvellous city of marble walls and silver fountains seen below terraces in the sunset . of these things , however , he learned nothing ; though he once thought that a certain old slant-eyed merchant looked queerly intelligent when the cold waste was spoken of . this man was reputed to trade with the horrible stone villages on the icy desert plateau of leng , which no healthy folk visit and whose evil fires are seen at night from afar . he was even rumoured to have dealt with that high-priest not to be described , which wears a yellow silken mask over its face and dwells all alone in a prehistoric stone monastery . that such a person might well have had nibbling traffick with such beings as may conceivably dwell in the cold waste was not to be doubted , but carter soon found that it was no use questioning him .\\n\\nthen the black galley slipped into the harbour past the basalt wale and the tall lighthouse , silent and alien , and with a strange stench that the south wind drove into the town . uneasiness rustled through the taverns along that waterfront , and after a while the dark wide--mouthed merchants with humped turbans and short feet clumped steathily ashore to seek the bazaars of the jewellers . carter observed them closely , and disliked them more the longer he looked at them . then he saw them drive the stout black men of parg up the gangplank grunting and sweating into that singular galley , and wondered in what lands--or if in any lands at all--those fat pathetic creatures might be destined to serve .\\n\\nand on the third evening of that galley\\'s stay one of the uncomfortable merchants spoke to him , smirking sinfully and hinting of what he had heard in the taverns of carter\\'s quest . he appeared to have knowledge too secret for public telling ; and although the sound of his voice was unbearably hateful , carter felt that the lore of so far a traveller must not be overlooked . he bade him therefore be his guest in locked chambers above , and drew out the last of the zoogs\\' moon-wine to loosen his tongue . the strange merchant drank heavily , but smirked unchanged by the draught . then he drew forth a curious bottle with wine of his own , and carter saw that the bottle was a single hollowed ruby , grotesquely carved in patterns too fabulous to be comprehended . he offered his wine to his host , and though carter took only the least sip , he felt the dizziness of space and the fever of unimagined jungles . all the while the guest had been smiling more and more broadly , and as carter slipped into blankness the last thing he saw was that dark odious face convulsed with evil laughter and something quite unspeakable where one of the two frontal puffs of that orange turban had become disarranged with the shakings of that epileptic mirth .\\n\\ncarter next had consciousness amidst horrible odours beneath a tent--like awning on the deck of a ship , with the marvellous coasts of the southern sea flying by in unnatural swiftness . he was not chained , but three of the dark sardonic merchants stood grinning nearby , and the sight of those humps in their turbans made him almost as faint as did the stench that filtered up through the sinister hatches . he saw slip past him the glorious lands and cities of which a fellow-dreamer of earth--a lighthouse-keeper in ancient kingsport--had often discoursed in the old days , and recognized the templed terraces of zak , abode of forgotten dreams ; the spires of infamous thalarion , that daemon-city of a thousand wonders where the eidolon lathi reigns ; the charnel gardens of zura , land of pleasures unattained , and the twin headlands of crystal , meeting above in a resplendent arch , which guard the harbour of sona-nyl , blessed land of fancy .\\n\\npast all these gorgeous lands the malodourous ship flew unwholesomely , urged by the abnormal strokes of those unseen rowers below . and before the day was done carter saw that the steersman could have no other goal than the basalt pillars of the west , beyond which simple folk say splendid cathuria lies , but which wise dreamers well know are the gates of a monstrous cataract wherein the oceans of earth\\'s dreamland drop wholly to abysmal nothingness and shoot through the empty spaces toward other worlds and other stars and the awful voids outside the ordered universe where the daemon sultan azathoth gnaws hungrily in chaos amid pounding and piping and the hellish dancing of the other gods , blind , voiceless , tenebrous , and mindless , with their soul and messenger nyarlathotep .\\n\\nmeanwhile the three sardonic merchants would give no word of their intent , though carter well knew that they must be leagued with those who wished to hold him from his quest . it is understood in the land of dream that the other gods have many agents moving among men ; and all these agents , whether wholly human or slightly less than human , are eager to work the will of those blind and mindless things in return for the favour of their hideous soul and messenger , the crawling chaos nyarlathotep . so carter inferred that the merchants of the humped turbans , hearing of his daring search for the great ones in their castle of kadath , had decided to take him away and deliver him to nyarlathotep for whatever nameless bounty might be offered for such a prize . what might be the land of those merchants in our known universe or in the eldritch spaces outside , carter could not guess ; nor could he imagine at what hellish trysting-place they would meet the crawling chaos to give him up and claim their reward . he knew , however , that no beings as nearly human as these would dare approach the ultimate nighted throne of the daemon azathoth in the formless central void .\\n\\nat the set of sun the merchants licked their excessively wide lips and glared hungrily and one of them went below and returned from some hidden and offensive cabin with a pot and basket of plates . then they squatted close together beneath the awning and ate the smoking meat that was passed around . but when they gave carter a portion , he found something very terrible in the size and shape of it ; so that he turned even paler than before and cast that portion into the sea when no eye was on him . and again he thought of those unseen rowers beneath , and of the suspicious nourishment from which their far too mechanical strength was derived .\\n\\nit was dark when the galley passed betwixt the basalt pillars of the west and the sound of the ultimate cataract swelled portentous from ahead . and the spray of that cataract rose to obscure the stars , and the deck grew damp , and the vessel reeled in the surging current of the brink . then with a queer whistle and plunge the leap was taken , and carter felt the terrors of nightmare as earth fell away and the great boat shot silent and comet-like into planetary space . never before had he known what shapeless black things lurk and caper and flounder all through the aether , leering and grinning at such voyagers as may pass , and sometimes feeling about with slimy paws when some moving object excites their curiosity . these are the nameless larvae of the other gods , and like them are blind and without mind , and possessed of singular hungers and thirsts .\\n\\nbut that offensive galley did not aim as far as carter had feared , for he soon saw that the helmsman was steering a course directly for the moon . the moon was a crescent shining larger and larger as they approached it , and shewing its singular craters and peaks uncomfortably . the ship made for the edge , and it soon became clear that its destination was that secret and mysterious side which is always turned away from earth , and which no fully human person , save perhaps the dreamer snireth-ko , has ever beheld . the close aspect of the moon as the galley drew near proved very disturbing to carter , and he did not like the size and shape of the ruins which crumbled here and there . the dead temples on the mountains were so placed that they could have glorified no suitable or wholesome gods , and in the symmetries of the broken columns there seemed to be some dark and inner meaning which did not invite solution . and what the structure and proportions of the olden worshippers could have been , carter steadily refused to conjecture .\\n\\nwhen the ship rounded the edge , and sailed over those lands unseen by man , there appeared in the queer landscape certain signs of life , and carter saw many low , broad , round cottages in fields of grotesque whitish fungi . he noticed that these cottages had no windows , and thought that their shape suggested the huts of esquimaux . then he glimpsed the oily waves of a sluggish sea , and knew that the voyage was once more to be by water--or at least through some liquid . the galley struck the surface with a peculiar sound , and the odd elastic way the waves received it was very perplexing to carter .\\n\\nthey now slid along at great speed , once passing and hailing another galley of kindred form , but generally seeing nothing but that curious sea and a sky that was black and star-strewn even though the sun shone scorchingly in it .\\n\\nthere presently rose ahead the jagged hills of a leprous-looking coast , and carter saw the thick unpleasant grey towers of a city . the way they leaned and bent , the manner in which they were clustered , and the fact that they had no windows at all , was very disturbing to the prisoner ; and he bitterly mourned the folly which had made him sip the curious wine of that merchant with the humped turban . as the coast drew nearer , and the hideous stench of that city grew stronger , he saw upon the jagged hills many forests , some of whose trees he recognized as akin to that solitary moon-tree in the enchanted wood of earth , from whose sap the small brown zoogs ferment their curious wine .\\n\\ncarter could now distinguish moving figures on the noisome wharves ahead , and the better he saw them the worse he began to fear and detest them . for they were not men at all , or even approximately men , but great greyish-white slippery things which could expand and contract at will , and whose principal shape--though it often changed--was that of a sort of toad without any eyes , but with a curious vibrating mass of short pink tentacles on the end of its blunt , vague snout . these objects were waddling busily about the wharves , moving bales and crates and boxes with preternatural strength , and now and then hopping on or off some anchored galley with long oars in their forepaws . and now and then one would appear driving a herd of clumping slaves , which indeed were approximate human beings with wide mouths like those merchants who traded in dylath-leen ; only these herds , being without turbans or shoes or clothing , did not seem so very human after all . some of the slaves--the fatter ones , whom a sort of overseer would pinch experimentally--were unloaded from ships and nailed in crates which workers pushed into the low warehouses or loaded on great lumbering vans .\\n\\nonce a van was hitched and driven off , and the fabulous thing which drew it was such that carter gasped , even after having seen the other monstrosities of that hateful place . now and then a small herd of slaves dressed and turbaned like the dark merchants would be driven aboard a galley , followed by a great crew of the slippery toad-things as officers , navigators , and rowers . and carter saw that the almost--human creatures were reserved for the more ignominious kinds of servitude which required no strength , such as steering and cooking , fetching and carrying , and bargaining with men on the earth or other planets where they traded . these creatures must have been convenient on earth , for they were truly not unlike men when dressed and carefully shod and turbaned , and could haggle in the shops of men without embarrassment or curious explanations . but most of them , unless lean or ill-favoured , were unclothed and packed in crates and drawn off in lumbering lorries by fabulous things . occasionally other beings were unloaded and crated ; some very like these semi-humans , some not so similar , and some not similar at all . and he wondered if any of the poor stout black men of parg were left to be unloaded and crated and shipped inland in those obnoxious drays .\\n\\nwhen the galley landed at a greasy-looking quay of spongy rock a nightmare horde of toad-things wiggled out of the hatches , and two of them seized carter and dragged him ashore . the smell and aspect of that city are beyond telling , and carter held only scattered images of the tiled streets and black doorways and endless precipices of grey vertical walls without windows . at length he was dragged within a low doorway and made to climb infinite steps in pitch blackness . it was , apparently , all one to the toad-things whether it were light or dark . the odour of the place was intolerable , and when carter was locked into a chamber and left alone he scarcely had strength to crawl around and ascertain its form and dimensions . it was circular , and about twenty feet across .\\n\\nfrom then on time ceased to exist . at intervals food was pushed in , but carter would not touch it . what his fate would be , he did not know ; but he felt that he was held for the coming of that frightful soul and messenger of infinity\\'s other gods , the crawling chaos nyarlathotep . finally , after an unguessed span of hours or days , the great stone door swung wide again , and carter was shoved down the stairs and out into the red-litten streets of that fearsome city . it was night on the moon , and all through the town were stationed slaves bearing torches .\\n\\nin a detestable square a sort of procession was formed ; ten of the toad-things and twenty-four almost human torch-bearers , eleven on either side , and one each before and behind . carter was placed in the middle of the line ; five toad-things ahead and five behind , and one almost-human torch-bearer on either side of him . certain of the toad-things produced disgustingly carven flutes of ivory and made loathsome sounds . to that hellish piping the column advanced out of the tiled streets and into nighted plains of obscene fungi , soon commencing to climb one of the lower and more gradual hills that lay behind the city . that on some frightful slope or blasphemous plateau the crawling chaos waited , carter could not doubt ; and he wished that the suspense might soon be over . the whining of those impious flutes was shocking , and he would have given worlds for some even half-normal sound ; but these toad-things had no voices , and the slaves did not talk .\\n\\nthen through that star-specked darkness there did come a normal sound . it rolled from the higher hills , and from all the jagged peaks around it was caught up and echoed in a swelling pandaemoniac chorus . it was the midnight yell of the cat , and carter knew at last that the old village folk were right when they made low guesses about the cryptical realms which are known only to cats , and to which the elders among cats repair by stealth nocturnally , springing from high housetops . verily , it is to the moon\\'s dark side that they go to leap and gambol on the hills and converse with ancient shadows , and here amidst that column of foetid things carter heard their homely , friendly cry , and thought of the steep roofs and warm hearths and little lighted windows of home .\\n\\nnow much of the speech of cats was known to randolph carter , and in this far terrible place he uttered the cry that was suitable . but that he need not have done , for even as his lips opened he heard the chorus wax and draw nearer , and saw swift shadows against the stars as small graceful shapes leaped from hill to hill in gathering legions . the call of the clan had been given , and before the foul procession had time even to be frightened a cloud of smothering fur and a phalanx of murderous claws were tidally and tempestuously upon it . the flutes stopped , and there were shrieks in the night . dying almost-humans screamed , and cats spit and yowled and roared , but the toad-things made never a sound as their stinking green ichor oozed fatally upon that porous earth with the obscene fungi .\\n\\nit was a stupendous sight while the torches lasted , and carter had never before seen so many cats . black , grey , and white ; yellow , tiger , and mixed ; common , persian , and marix ; thibetan , angora , and egyptian ; all were there in the fury of battle , and there hovered over them some trace of that profound and inviolate sanctity which made their goddess great in the temples of bubastis . they would leap seven strong at the throat of an almost-human or the pink tentacled snout of a toad-thing and drag it down savagely to the fungous plain , where myriads of their fellows would surge over it and into it with the frenzied claws and teeth of a divine battle-fury . carter had seized a torch from a stricken slave , but was soon overborne by the surging waves of his loyal defenders . then he lay in the utter blackness hearing the clangour of war and the shouts of the victors , and feeling the soft paws of his friends as they rushed to and fro over him in the fray .\\n\\nat last awe and exhaustion closed his eyes , and when he opened them again it was upon a strange scene . the great shining disc of the earth , thirteen times greater than that of the moon as we see it , had risen with floods of weird light over the lunar landscape ; and across all those leagues of wild plateau and ragged crest there squatted one endless sea of cats in orderly array . circle on circle they reached , and two or three leaders out of the ranks were licking his face and purring to him consolingly . of the dead slaves and toad-things there were not many signs , but carter thought he saw one bone a little way off in the open space between him and the warriors .\\n\\ncarter now spoke with the leaders in the soft language of cats , and learned that his ancient friendship with the species was well known and often spoken of in the places where cats congregate . he had not been unmarked in ulthar when he passed through , and the sleek old cats had remembered how he patted them after they had attended to the hungry zoogs who looked evilly at a small black kitten . and they recalled , too , how he had welcomed the very little kitten who came to see him at the inn , and how he had given it a saucer of rich cream in the morning before he left . the grandfather of that very little kitten was the leader of the army now assembled , for he had seen the evil procession from a far hill and recognized the prisoner as a sworn friend of his kind on earth and in the land of dream .\\n\\na yowl now came from the farther peak , and the old leader paused abruptly in his conversation . it was one of the army\\'s outposts , stationed on the highest of the mountains to watch the one foe which earth\\'s cats fear ; the very large and peculiar cats from saturn , who for some reason have not been oblivious of the charm of our moon\\'s dark side . they are leagued by treaty with the evil toad-things , and are notoriously hostile to our earthly cats ; so that at this juncture a meeting would have been a somewhat grave matter .\\n\\nafter a brief consultation of generals , the cats rose and assumed a closer formation , crowding protectingly around carter and preparing to take the great leap through space back to the housetops of our earth and its dreamland . the old field-marshal advised carter to let himself be borne along smoothly and passively in the massed ranks of furry leapers , and told him how to spring when the rest sprang and land gracefully when the rest landed . he also offered to deposit him in any spot he desired , and carter decided on the city of dylath-leen whence the black galley had set out ; for he wished to sail thence for oriab and the carven crest ngranek , and also to warn the people of the city to have no more traffick with black galleys , if indeed that traffick could be tactfully and judiciously broken off . then , upon a signal , the cats all leaped gracefully with their friend packed securely in their midst ; while in a black cave on an unhallowed summit of the moon-mountains still vainly waited the crawling chaos nyarlathotep .\\n\\nthe leap of the cats through space was very swift ; and being surrounded by his companions carter did not see this time the great black shapelessnesses that lurk and caper and flounder in the abyss . before he fully realised what had happened he was back in his familiar room at the inn at dylath-leen , and the stealthy , friendly cats were pouring out of the window in streams . the old leader from ulthar was the last to leave , and as carter shook his paw he said he would be able to get home by cockcrow . when dawn came , carter went downstairs and learned that a week had elapsed since his capture and leaving . there was still nearly a fortnight to wait for the ship bound toward oriab , and during that time he said what he could against the black galleys and their infamous ways . most of the townsfolk believed him ; yet so fond were the jewellers of great rubies that none would wholly promise to cease trafficking with the wide-mouthed merchants . if aught of evil ever befalls dylath-leen through such traffick , it will not be his fault .\\n\\nin about a week the desiderate ship put in by the black wale and tall lighthouse , and carter was glad to see that she was a barque of wholesome men , with painted sides and yellow lateen sails and a grey captain in silken robes . her cargo was the fragrant resin of oriab\\'s inner groves , and the delicate pottery baked by the artists of baharna , and the strange little figures carved from ngranek\\'s ancient lava . for this they were paid in the wool of ulthar and the iridescent textiles of hatheg and the ivory that the black men carve across the river in parg . carter made arrangements with the captain to go to baharna and was told that the voyage would take ten days . and during his week of waiting he talked much with that captain of ngranek , and was told that very few had seen the carven face thereon ; but that most travellers are content to learn its legends from old people and lava--gatherers and image-makers in baharna and afterward say in their far homes that they have indeed beheld it . the captain was not even sure that any person now living had beheld that carven face , for the wrong side of ngranek is very difficult and barren and sinister , and there are rumours of caves near the peak wherein dwell the night-gaunts . but the captain did not wish to say just what a night-gaunt might be like , since such cattle are known to haunt most persistently the dreams of those who think too often of them . then carter asked that captain about unknown kadath in the cold waste , and the marvellous sunset city , but of these the good man could truly tell nothing .\\n\\ncarter sailed out of dylath-leen one early morning when the tide turned , and saw the first rays of sunrise on the thin angular towers of that dismal basalt town . and for two days they sailed eastward in sight of green coasts , and saw often the pleasant fishing towns that climbed up steeply with their red roofs and chimney-pots from old dreaming wharves and beaches where nets lay drying . but on the third day they turned sharply south where the roll of water was stronger , and soon passed from sight of any land . on the fifth day the sailors were nervous , but the captain apologized for their fears , saying that the ship was about to pass over the weedy walls and broken columns of a sunken city too old for memory , and that when the water was clear one could see so many moving shadows in that deep place that simple folk disliked it . he admitted , moreover , that many ships had been lost in that part of the sea ; having been hailed when quite close to it , but never seen again .\\n\\nthat night the moon was very bright , and one could see a great way down in the water . there was so little wind that the ship could not move much , and the ocean was very calm . looking over the rail carter saw many fathoms deep the dome of the great temple , and in front of it an avenue of unnatural sphinxes leading to what was once a public square . dolphins sported merrily in and out of the ruins , and porpoises revelled clumsily here and there , sometimes coming to the surface and leaping clear out of the sea . as the ship drifted on a little the floor of the ocean rose in hills , and one could clearly mark the lines of ancient climbing streets and the washed-down walls of myriad little houses .\\n\\nthen the suburbs appeared , and finally a great lone building on a hill , of simpler architecture than the other structures , and in much better repair . it was dark and low and covered four sides of a square , with a tower at each corner , a paved court in the centre , and small curious round windows all over it . probably it was of basalt , though weeds draped the greater part ; and such was its lonely and impressive place on that far hill that it may have been a temple or a monastery . some phosphorescent fish inside it gave the small round windows an aspect of shining , and carter did not blame the sailors much for their fears . then by the watery moonlight he noticed an odd high monolith in the middle of that central court , and saw that something was tied to it . and when after getting a telescope from the captain\\'s cabin he saw that that bound thing was a sailor in the silk robes of oriab , head downward and without any eyes , he was glad that a rising breeze soon took the ship ahead to more healthy parts of the sea .\\n\\nthe next day they spoke with a ship with violet sails bound for zar , in the land of forgotten dreams , with bulbs of strange coloured lilies for cargo . and on the evening of the eleventh day they came in sight of the isle of oriab with ngranek rising jagged and snow-crowned in the distance . oriab is a very great isle , and its port of baharna a mighty city . the wharves of baharna are of porphyry , and the city rises in great stone terraces behind them , having streets of steps that are frequently arched over by buildings and the bridges between buildings . there is a great canal which goes under the whole city in a tunnel with granite gates and leads to the inland lake of yath , on whose farther shore are the vast clay-brick ruins of a primal city whose name is not remembered . as the ship drew into the harbour at evening the twin beacons thon and thal gleamed a welcome , and in all the million windows of baharna\\'s terraces mellow lights peeped out quietly and gradually as the stars peep out overhead in the dusk , till that steep and climbing seaport became a glittering constellation hung between the stars of heaven and the reflections of those stars in the still harbour .\\n\\nthe captain , after landing , made carter a guest in his own small house on the shores of yath where the rear of the town slopes down to it ; and his wife and servants brought strange toothsome foods for the traveller\\'s delight . and in the days after that carter asked for rumours and legends of ngranek in all the taverns and public places where lava-gatherers and image-makers meet , but could find no one who had been up the higher slopes or seen the carven face . ngranek was a hard mountain with only an accursed valley behind it , and besides , one could never depend on the certainty that night-gaunts are altogether fabulous .\\n\\nwhen the captain sailed hack to dylath-leen carter took quarters in an ancient tavern opening on an alley of steps in the original part of the town , which is built of brick and resembles the ruins of yath\\'s farther shore . here he laid his plans for the ascent of ngranek , and correlated all that he had learned from the lava-gatherers about the roads thither . the keeper of the tavern was a very old man , and had heard so many legends that he was a great help . he even took carter to an upper room in that ancient house and shewed him a crude picture which a traveller had scratched on the clay wall in the old days when men were bolder and less reluctant to visit ngranek\\'s higher slopes . the old tavern-keeper\\'s great-grandfather had heard from his great--grandfather that the traveller who scratched that picture had climbed ngranek and seen the carven face , here drawing it for others to behold , but carter had very great doubts , since the large rough features on the wall were hasty and careless , and wholly overshadowed by a crowd of little companion shapes in the worst possible taste , with horns and wings and claws and curling tails .\\n\\nat last , having gained all the information he was likely to gain in the taverns and public places of baharna , carter hired a zebra and set out one morning on the road by yath\\'s shore for those inland parts wherein towers stony ngranek . on his right were rolling hills and pleasant orchards and neat little stone farmhouses , and he was much reminded of those fertile fields that flank the skai . by evening he was near the nameless ancient ruins on yath\\'s farther shore , and though old lava-gatherers had warned him not to camp there at night , he tethered his zebra to a curious pillar before a crumbling wall and laid his blanket in a sheltered corner beneath some carvings whose meaning none could decipher . around him he wrapped another blanket , for the nights are cold in oriab ; and when upon awaking once he thought he felt the wings of some insect brushing his face he covered his head altogether and slept in peace till roused by the magah birds in distant resin groves .\\n\\nthe sun had just come up over the great slope whereon leagues of primal brick foundations and worn walls and occasional cracked pillars and pedestals stretched down desolate to the shore of yath , and carter looked about for his tethered zebra . great was his dismay to see that docile beast stretched prostrate beside the curious pillar to which it had been tied , and still greater was he vexed on finding that the steed was quite dead , with its blood all sucked away through a singular wound in its throat . his pack had been disturbed , and several shiny knickknacks taken away , and all round on the dusty soil were great webbed footprints for which he could not in any way account . the legends and warnings of lava-gatherers occurred to him , and he thought of what had brushed his face in the night . then he shouldered his pack and strode on toward ngranek , though not without a shiver when he saw close to him as the highway passed through the ruins a great gaping arch low in the wall of an old temple , with steps leading down into darkness farther than he could peer .\\n\\nhis course now lay uphill through wilder and partly wooded country , and he saw only the huts of charcoal-burners and the camp of those who gathered resin from the groves . the whole air was fragrant with balsam , and all the magah birds sang blithely as they flashed their seven colours in the sun . near sunset he came on a new camp of lava--gatherers returning with laden sacks from ngranek\\'s lower slopes ; and here he also camped , listening to the songs and tales of the men , and overhearing what they whispered about a companion they had lost . he had climbed high to reach a mass of fine lava above him , and at nightfall did not return to his fellows . when they looked for him the next day they found only his turban , nor was there any sign on the crags below that he had fallen . they did not search any more , because the old man among them said it would be of no use .\\n\\nno one ever found what the night-gaunts took , though those beasts themselves were so uncertain as to be almost fabulous . carter asked them if night-gaunts sucked blood and liked shiny things and left webbed footprints , but they all shook their heads negatively and seemed frightened at his making such an inquiry . when he saw how taciturn they had become he asked them no more , but went to sleep in his blanket .\\n\\nthe next day he rose with the lava-gatherers and exchanged farewells as they rode west and he rode east on a zebra he bought of them . their older men gave him blessings and warnings , and told him he had better not climb too high on ngranek , but while he thanked them heartily he was in no wise dissuaded . for still did he feel that he must find the gods on unknown kadath ; and win from them a way to that haunting and marvellous city in the sunset . by noon , after a long uphill ride , he came upon some abandoned brick villages of the hill-people who had once dwelt thus close to ngranek and carved images from its smooth lava . here they had dwelt till the days of the old tavernkeeper\\'s grandfather , but about that time they felt that their presence was disliked . their homes had crept even up the mountain\\'s slope , and the higher they built the more people they would miss when the sun rose . at last they decided it would be better to leave altogether , since things were sometimes glimpsed in the darkness which no one could interpret favourably ; so in the end all of them went down to the sea and dwelt in baharna , inhabiting a very old quarter and teaching their sons the old art of image-making which to this day they carry on . it was from these children of the exiled hill-people that carter had heard the best tales about ngranek when searching through baharna\\'s ancient taverns .\\n\\nall this time the great gaunt side of ngranek was looming up higher and higher as carter approached it . there were sparse trees on the lower slopes and feeble shrubs above them , and then the bare hideous rock rose spectral into the sky , to mix with frost and ice and eternal snow . carter could see the rifts and ruggedness of that sombre stone , and did not welcome the prospect of climbing it . in places there were solid streams of lava , and scoriac heaps that littered slopes and ledges . ninety aeons ago , before even the gods had danced upon its pointed peak , that mountain had spoken with fire and roared with the voices of the inner thunders . now it towered all silent and sinister , bearing on the hidden side that secret titan image whereof rumour told . and there were caves in that mountain , which might be empty and alone with elder darkness , or might--if legend spoke truly--hold horrors of a form not to be surmised .\\n\\nthe ground sloped upward to the foot of ngranek , thinly covered with scrub oaks and ash trees , and strewn with bits of rock , lava , and ancient cinder . there were the charred embers of many camps , where the lava-gatherers were wont to stop , and several rude altars which they had built either to propitiate the great ones or to ward off what they dreamed of in ngranek\\'s high passes and labyrinthine caves . at evening carter reached the farthermost pile of embers and camped for the night , tethering his zebra to a sapling and wrapping himself well in his blankets before going to sleep . and all through the night a voonith howled distantly from the shore of some hidden pool , but carter felt no fear of that amphibious terror , since he had been told with certainty that not one of them dares even approach the slope of ngranek .\\n\\nin the clear sunshine of morning carter began the long ascent , taking his zebra as far as that useful beast could go , but tying it to a stunted ash tree when the floor of the thin wood became too steep . thereafter he scrambled up alone ; first through the forest with its ruins of old villages in overgrown clearings , and then over the tough grass where anaemic shrubs grew here and there . he regretted coming clear of the trees , since the slope was very precipitous and the whole thing rather dizzying . at length he began to discern all the countryside spread out beneath him whenever he looked about ; the deserted huts of the image-makers , the groves of resin trees and the camps of those who gathered from them , the woods where prismatic magahs nest and sing , and even a hint very far away of the shores of yath and of those forbidding ancient ruins whose name is forgotten . he found it best not to look around , and kept on climbing and climbing till the shrubs became very sparse and there was often nothing but the tough grass to cling to .\\n\\nthen the soil became meagre , with great patches of bare rock cropping out , and now and then the nest of a condor in a crevice . finally there was nothing at all but the bare rock , and had it not been very rough and weathered , he could scarcely have ascended farther . knobs , ledges , and pinnacles , however , helped greatly ; and it was cheering to see occasionally the sign of some lava-gatherer scratched clumsily in the friable stone , and know that wholesome human creatures had been there before him . after a certain height the presence of man was further shewn by handholds and footholds hewn where they were needed , and by little quarries and excavations where some choice vein or stream of lava had been found . in one place a narrow ledge had been chopped artificially to an especially rich deposit far to the right of the main line of ascent . once or twice carter dared to look around , and was almost stunned by the spread of landscape below . all the island betwixt him and the coast lay open to his sight , with baharna\\'s stone terraces and the smoke of its chimneys mystical in the distance . and beyond that the illimitable southern sea with all its curious secrets .\\n\\nthus far there had been much winding around the mountain , so that the farther and carven side was still hidden . carter now saw a ledge running upward and to the left which seemed to head the way he wished , and this course he took in the hope that it might prove continuous . after ten minutes he saw it was indeed no cul-de-sac , but that it led steeply on in an arc which would , unless suddenly interrupted or deflected , bring him after a few hours\\' climbing to that unknown southern slope overlooking the desolate crags and the accursed valley of lava . as new country came into view below him he saw that it was bleaker and wilder than those seaward lands he had traversed . the mountain\\'s side , too , was somewhat different ; being here pierced by curious cracks and caves not found on the straighter route he had left . some of these were above him and some beneath him , all opening on sheerly perpendicular cliffs and wholly unreachable by the feet of man . the air was very cold now , but so hard was the climbing that he did not mind it . only the increasing rarity bothered him , and he thought that perhaps it was this which had turned the heads of other travellers and excited those absurd tales of night-gaunts whereby they explained the loss of such climbers as fell from these perilous paths . he was not much impressed by travellers\\' tales , but had a good curved scimitar in case of any trouble . all lesser thoughts were lost in the wish to see that carven face which might set him on the track of the gods atop unknown kadath .\\n\\nat last , in the fearsome iciness of upper space , he came round fully to the hidden side of ngranek and saw in infinite gulfs below him the lesser crags and sterile abysses of lava which marked olden wrath of the great ones . there was unfolded , too , a vast expanse of country to the south ; but it was a desert land without fair fields or cottage chimneys , and seemed to have no ending . no trace of the sea was visible on this side , for oriab is a great island . black caverns and odd crevices were still numerous on the sheer vertical cliffs , but none of them was accessible to a climber . there now loomed aloft a great beetling mass which hampered the upward view , and carter was for a moment shaken with doubt lest it prove impassable . poised in windy insecurity miles above earth , with only space and death on one side and only slippery walls of rock on the other , he knew for a moment the fear that makes men shun ngranek\\'s hidden side . he could not turn round , yet the sun was already low . if there were no way aloft , the night would find him crouching there still , and the dawn would not find him at all .\\n\\nbut there was a way , and he saw it in due season . only a very expert dreamer could have used those imperceptible footholds , yet to carter they were sufficient . surmounting now the outward-hanging rock , he found the slope above much easier than that below , since a great glacier\\'s melting had left a generous space with loam and ledges . to the left a precipice dropped straight from unknown heights to unknown depths , with a cave\\'s dark mouth just out of reach above him . elsewhere , however , the mountain slanted back strongly , and even gave him space to lean and rest .\\n\\nhe felt from the chill that he must be near the snow line , and looked up to see what glittering pinnacles might be shining in that late ruddy sunlight . surely enough , there was the snow uncounted thousands of feet above , and below it a great beetling crag like that he had just climbed ; hanging there forever in bold outline . and when he saw that crag he gasped and cried out aloud , and clutched at the jagged rock in awe ; for the titan bulge had not stayed as earth\\'s dawn had shaped it , but gleamed red and stupendous in the sunset with the carved and polished features of a god .\\n\\nstern and terrible shone that face that the sunset lit with fire . how vast it was no mind can ever measure , but carter knew at once that man could never have fashioned it . it was a god chiselled by the hands of the gods , and it looked down haughty and majestic upon the seeker . rumour had said it was strange and not to be mistaken , and carter saw that it was indeed so ; for those long narrow eyes and long-lobed ears , and that thin nose and pointed chin , all spoke of a race that is not of men but of gods .\\n\\nhe clung overawed in that lofty and perilous eyrie , even though it was this which he had expected and come to find ; for there is in a god\\'s face more of marvel than prediction can tell , and when that face is vaster than a great temple and seen looking downward at sunset in the scyptic silences of that upper world from whose dark lava it was divinely hewn of old , the marvel is so strong that none may escape it .\\n\\nhere , too , was the added marvel of recognition ; for although he had planned to search all dreamland over for those whose likeness to this face might mark them as the god\\'s children , he now knew that he need not do so . certainly , the great face carven on that mountain was of no strange sort , but the kin of such as he had seen often in the taverns of the seaport celephais which lies in ooth-nargai beyond the tanarian hills and is ruled over by that king kuranes whom carter once knew in waking life . every year sailors with such a face came in dark ships from the north to trade their onyx for the carved jade and spun gold and little red singing birds of celephais , and it was clear that these could be no others than the half-gods he sought . where they dwelt , there must the cold waste lie close , and within it unknown kadath and its onyx castle for the great ones . so to celephais he must go , far distant from the isle of oriab , and in such parts as would take him back to dylath-teen and up the skai to the bridge by nir , and again into the enchanted wood of the zoogs , whence the way would bend northward through the garden lands by oukranos to the gilded spires of thran , where he might find a galleon bound over the cerenarian sea .\\n\\nbut dusk was now thick , and the great carven face looked down even sterner in shadow . perched on that ledge night found the seeker ; and in the blackness he might neither go down nor go up , but only stand and cling and shiver in that narrow place till the day came , praying to keep awake lest sleep loose his hold and send him down the dizzy miles of air to the crags and sharp rocks of the accursed valley . the stars came out , but save for them there was only black nothingness in his eyes ; nothingness leagued with death , against whose beckoning he might do no more than cling to the rocks and lean back away from an unseen brink . the last thing of earth that he saw in the gloaming was a condor soaring close to the westward precipice beside him , and darting screaming away when it came near the cave whose mouth yawned just out of reach .\\n\\nsuddenly , without a warning sound in the dark , carter felt his curved scimitar drawn stealthily out of his belt by some unseen hand . then he heard it clatter down over the rocks below . and between him and the milky way he thought he saw a very terrible outline of something noxiously thin and horned and tailed and bat-winged . other things , too , had begun to blot out patches of stars west of him , as if a flock of vague entities were flapping thickly and silently out of that inaccessible cave in the face of the precipice . then a sort of cold rubbery arm seized his neck and something else seized his feet , and he was lifted inconsiderately up and swung about in space . another minute and the stars were gone , and carter knew that the night-gaunts had got him .\\n\\nthey bore him breathless into that cliffside cavern and through monstrous labyrinths beyond . when he struggled , as at first he did by instinct , they tickled him with deliberation . they made no sound at all themselves , and even their membranous wings were silent . they were frightfully cold and damp and slippery , and their paws kneaded one detestably . soon they were plunging hideously downward through inconceivable abysses in a whirling , giddying , sickening rush of dank , tomb-like air ; and carter felt they were shooting into the ultimate vortex of shrieking and daemonic madness . he screamed again and again , but whenever he did so the black paws tickled him with greater subtlety . then he saw a sort of grey phosphorescence about , and guessed they were coming even to that inner world of subterrene horror of which dim legends tell , and which is litten only by the pale death--fire wherewith reeks the ghoulish air and the primal mists of the pits at earth\\'s core .\\n\\nat last far below him he saw faint lines of grey and ominous pinnacles which he knew must be the fabled peaks of throk . awful and sinister they stand in the haunted disc of sunless and eternal depths ; higher than man may reckon , and guarding terrible valleys where the dholes crawl and burrow nastily . but carter preferred to look at them than at his captors , which were indeed shocking and uncouth black things with smooth , oily , whale-like surfaces , unpleasant horns that curved inward toward each other , bat wings whose beating made no sound , ugly prehensile paws , and barbed tails that lashed needlessly and disquietingly . and worst of all , they never spoke or laughed , and never smiled because they had no faces at all to smile with , but only a suggestive blankness where a face ought to be . all they ever did was clutch and fly and tickle ; that was the way of night-gaunts .\\n\\nas the band flew lower the peaks of throk rose grey and towering on all sides , and one saw clearly that nothing lived on that austere and impressive granite of the endless twilight . at still lower levels the death-fires in the air gave out , and one met only the primal blackness of the void save aloft where the thin peaks stood out goblin-like . soon the peaks were very far away , and nothing about but great rushing winds with the dankness of nethermost grottoes in them . then in the end the night-gaunts landed on a floor of unseen things which felt like layers of bones , and left carter all alone in that black valley . to bring him thither was the duty of the night-gaunts that guard ngranek ; and this done , they flapped away silently . when carter tried to trace their flight he found he could not , since even the peaks of throk had faded out of sight . there was nothing anywhere but blackness and horror and silence and bones .\\n\\nnow carter knew from a certain source that he was in the vale of pnoth , where crawl and burrow the enormous dholes ; but he did not know what to expect , because no one has ever seen a dhole or even guessed what such a thing may be like . dholes are known only by dim rumour , from the rustling they make amongst mountains of bones and the slimy touch they have when they wriggle past one . they cannot be seen because they creep only in the dark . carter did not wish to meet a dhole , so listened intently for any sound in the unknown depths of bones about him . even in this fearsome place he had a plan and an objective , for whispers of pnoth were not unknown to one with whom he had talked much in the old days . in brief , it seemed fairly likely that this was the spot into which all the ghouls of the waking world cast the refuse of their feastings ; and that if he but had good luck he might stumble upon that mighty crag taller even than throk\\'s peaks which marks the edge of their domain . showers of bones would tell him where to look , and once found he could call to a ghoul to let down a ladder ; for strange to say , he had a very singular link with these terrible creatures .\\n\\na man he had known in boston--a painter of strange pictures with a secret studio in an ancient and unhallowed alley near a graveyard--had actually made friends with the ghouls and had taught him to understand the simpler part of their disgusting meeping and glibbering . this man had vanished at last , and carter was not sure but that he might find him now , and use for the first time in dreamland that far-away english of his dim waking life . in any case , he felt he could persuade a ghoul to guide him out of pnoth ; and it would be better to meet a ghoul , which one can see , than a dhole , which one cannot see .\\n\\nso carter walked in the dark , and ran when he thought he heard something among the bones underfoot . once he bumped into a stony slope , and knew it must be the base of one of throk\\'s peaks . then at last he heard a monstrous rattling and clatter which reached far up in the air , and became sure he had come nigh the crag of the ghouls . he was not sure he could be heard from this valley miles below , but realised that the inner world has strange laws . as he pondered he was struck by a flying bone so heavy that it must have been a skull , and therefore realising his nearness to the fateful crag he sent up as best he might that meeping cry which is the call of the ghoul .\\n\\nsound travels slowly , so it was some time before he heard an answering glibber . but it came at last , and before long he was told that a rope ladder would be lowered . the wait for this was very tense , since there was no telling what might not have been stirred up among those bones by his shouting . indeed , it was not long before he actually did hear a vague rustling afar off . as this thoughtfully approached , he became more and more uncomfortable ; for he did not wish to move away from the spot where the ladder would come . finally the tension grew almost unbearable , and he was about to flee in panic when the thud of something on the newly heaped bones nearby drew his notice from the other sound . it was the ladder , and after a minute of groping he had it taut in his hands . but the other sound did not cease , and followed him even as he climbed . he had gone fully five feet from the ground when the rattling beneath waxed emphatic , and was a good ten feet up when something swayed the ladder from below . at a height which must have been fifteen or twenty feet he felt his whole side brushed by a great slippery length which grew alternately convex and concave with wriggling ; and hereafter he climbed desperately to escape the unendurable nuzzling of that loathsome and overfed dhole whose form no man might see .\\n\\nfor hours he climbed with aching and blistered hands , seeing again the grey death-fire and throk\\'s uncomfortable pinnacles . at last he discerned above him the projecting edge of the great crag of the ghouls , whose vertical side he could not glimpse ; and hours later he saw a curious face peering over it as a gargoyle peers over a parapet of notre dame . this almost made him lose his hold through faintness , but a moment later he was himself again ; for his vanished friend richard pickman had once introduced him to a ghoul , and he knew well their canine faces and slumping forms and unmentionable idiosyncrasies . so he had himself well under control when that hideous thing pulled him out of the dizzy emptiness over the edge of the crag , and did not scream at the partly consumed refuse heaped at one side or at the squatting circles of ghouls who gnawed and watched curiously .\\n\\nhe was now on a dim-litten plain whose sole topographical features were great boulders and the entrances of burrows . the ghouls were in general respectful , even if one did attempt to pinch him while several others eyed his leanness speculatively . through patient glibbering he made inquiries regarding his vanished friend , and found he had become a ghoul of some prominence in abysses nearer the waking world . a greenish elderly ghoul offered to conduct him to pickman\\'s present habitation , so despite a natural loathing he followed the creature into a capacious burrow and crawled after him for hours in the blackness of rank mould . they emerged on a dim plain strewn with singular relics of earth--old gravestones , broken urns , and grotesque fragments of monuments--and carter realised with some emotion that he was probably nearer the waking world than at any other time since he had gone down the seven hundred steps from the cavern of flame to the gate of deeper slumber .\\n\\nthere , on a tombstone of 1768 stolen from the granary burying ground in boston , sat a ghoul which was once the artist richard upton pickman . it was naked and rubbery , and had acquired so much of the ghoulish physiognomy that its human origin was already obscure . but it still remembered a little english , and was able to converse with carter in grunts and monosyllables , helped out now and then by the glibbering of ghouls . when it learned that carter wished to get to the enchanted wood and from there to the city celephais in ooth-nargai beyond the tanarian hills , it seemed rather doubtful ; for these ghouls of the waking world do no business in the graveyards of upper dreamland (leaving that to the red-footed wamps that are spawned in dead cities) , and many things intervene betwixt their gulf and the enchanted wood , including the terrible kingdom of the gugs .\\n\\nthe gugs , hairy and gigantic , once reared stone circles in that wood and made strange sacrifices to the other gods and the crawling chaos nyarlathotep , until one night an abomination of theirs reached the ears of earth\\'s gods and they were banished to caverns below . only a great trap door of stone with an iron ring connects the abyss of the earth-ghouls with the enchanted wood , and this the gugs are afraid to open because of a curse . that a mortal dreamer could traverse their cavern realm and leave by that door is inconceivable ; for mortal dreamers were their former food , and they have legends of the toothsomeness of such dreamers even though banishment has restricted their diet to the ghasts , those repulsive beings which die in the light , and which live in the vaults of zin and leap on long hind legs like kangaroos .\\n\\nso the ghoul that was pickman advised carter either to leave the abyss at sarkomand , that deserted city in the valley below leng where black nitrous stairways guarded by winged diarote lions lead down from dreamland to the lower gulfs , or to return through a churchyard to the waking world and begin the quest anew down the seventy steps of light slumber to the cavern of flame and the seven hundred steps to the gate of deeper slumber and the enchanted wood . this , however , did not suit the seeker ; for he knew nothing of the way from leng to ooth-nargai , and was likewise reluctant to awake lest he forget all he had so far gained in this dream . it was disastrous to his quest to forget the august and celestial faces of those seamen from the north who traded onyx in celephais , and who , being the sons of gods , must point the way to the cold waste and kadath where the great ones dwell .\\n\\nafter much persuasion the ghoul consented to guide his guest inside the great wall of the gugs\\' kingdom . there was one chance that carter might be able to steal through that twilight realm of circular stone towers at an hour when the giants would be all gorged and snoring indoors , and reach the central tower with the sign of koth upon it , which has the stairs leading up to that stone trap door in the enchanted wood . pickman even consented to lend three ghouls to help with a tombstone lever in raising the stone door ; for of ghouls the gugs are somewhat afraid , and they often flee from their own colossal graveyards when they see them feasting there .\\n\\nhe also advised carter to disguise as a ghoul himself ; shaving the beard he had allowed to grow (for ghouls have none) , wallowing naked in the mould to get the correct surface , and loping in the usual slumping way , with his clothing carried in a bundle as if it were a choice morsel from a tomb . they would reach the city of gugs--which is coterminous with the whole kingdom--through the proper burrows , emerging in a cemetery not far from the stair-containing tower of koth . they must beware , however , of a large cave near the cemetery ; for this is the mouth of the vaults of zin , and the vindictive ghasts are always on watch there murderously for those denizens of the upper abyss who hunt and prey on them . the ghasts try to come out when the gugs sleep and they attack ghouls as readily as gugs , for they cannot discriminate . they are very primitive , and eat one another . the gugs have a sentry at a narrow in the vaults of zin , but he is often drowsy and is sometimes surprised by a party of ghasts . though ghasts cannot live in real light , they can endure the grey twilight of the abyss for hours .\\n\\nso at length carter crawled through endless burrows with three helpful ghouls bearing the slate gravestone of col . nepemiah derby , obit 1719 , from the charter street burying ground in salem . when they came again into open twilight they were in a forest of vast lichened monoliths reaching nearly as high as the eye could see and forming the modest gravestones of the gugs . on the right of the hole out of which they wriggled , and seen through aisles of monoliths , was a stupendous vista of cyclopean round towers mounting up illimitable into the grey air of inner earth . this was the great city of the gugs , whose doorways are thirty feet high . ghouls come here often , for a buried gug will feed a community for almost a year , and even with the added peril it is better to burrow for gugs than to bother with the graves of men . carter now understood the occasional titan bones he had felt beneath him in the vale of pnoth .\\n\\nstraight ahead , and just outside the cemetery , rose a sheer perpendicular cliff at whose base an immense and forbidding cavern yawned . this the ghouls told carter to avoid as much as possible , since it was the entrance to the unhallowed vaults of zin where gugs hunt ghasts in the darkness . and truly , that warning was soon well justified ; for the moment a ghoul began to creep toward the towers to see if the hour of the gugs\\' resting had been rightly timed , there glowed in the gloom of that great cavern\\'s mouth first one pair of yellowish-red eyes and then another , implying that the gugs were one sentry less , and that ghasts have indeed an excellent sharpness of smell . so the ghoul returned to the burrow and motioned his companions to be silent . it was best to leave the ghasts to their own devices , and there was a possibility that they might soon withdraw , since they must naturally be rather tired after coping with a gug sentry in the black vaults . after a moment something about the size of a small horse hopped out into the grey twilight , and carter turned sick at the aspect of that scabrous and unwholesome beast , whose face is so curiously human despite the absence of a nose , a forehead , and other important particulars .\\n\\npresently three other ghasts hopped out to join their fellow , and a ghoul glibbered softly at carter that their absence of battle-scars was a bad sign . it proved that they had not fought the gug sentry at all , but had merely slipped past him as he slept , so that their strength and savagery were still unimpaired and would remain so till they had found and disposed of a victim . it was very unpleasant to see those filthy and disproportioned animals which soon numbered about fifteen , grubbing about and making their kangaroo leaps in the grey twilight where titan towers and monoliths arose , but it was still more unpleasant when they spoke among themselves in the coughing gutturals of ghasts . and yet , horrible as they were , they were not so horrible as what presently came out of the cave after them with disconcerting suddenness .\\n\\nit was a paw , fully two feet and a half across , and equipped with formidable talons . after it came another paw , and after that a great black-furred arm to which both of the paws were attached by short forearms . then two pink eyes shone , and the head of the awakened gug sentry , large as a barrel , wabbled into view . the eyes jutted two inches from each side , shaded by bony protuberances overgrown with coarse hairs . but the head was chiefly terrible because of the mouth . that mouth had great yellow fangs and ran from the top to the bottom of the head , opening vertically instead of horizontally .\\n\\nbut before that unfortunate gug could emerge from the cave and rise to his full twenty feet , the vindictive ghasts were upon him . carter feared for a moment that he would give an alarm and arouse all his kin , till a ghoul softly glibbered that gugs have no voice but talk by means of facial expression . the battle which then ensued was truly a frightful one . from all sides the venomous ghasts rushed feverishly at the creeping gug , nipping and tearing with their muzzles , and mauling murderously with their hard pointed hooves . all the time they coughed excitedly , screaming when the great vertical mouth of the gug would occasionally bite into one of their number , so that the noise of the combat would surely have aroused the sleeping city had not the weakening of the sentry begun to transfer the action farther and farther within the cavern . as it was , the tumult soon receded altogether from sight in the blackness , with only occasional evil echoes to mark its continuance .\\n\\nthen the most alert of the ghouls gave the signal for all to advance , and carter followed the loping three out of the forest of monoliths and into the dark noisome streets of that awful city whose rounded towers of cyclopean stone soared up beyond the sight . silently they shambled over that rough rock pavement , hearing with disgust the abominable muffled snortings from great black doorways which marked the slumber of the gugs . apprehensive of the ending of the rest hour , the ghouls set a somewhat rapid pace ; but even so the journey was no brief one , for distances in that town of giants are on a great scale . at last , however , they came to a somewhat open space before a tower even vaster than the rest ; above whose colossal doorway was fixed a monstrous symbol in bas-relief which made one shudder without knowing its meaning . this was the central tower with the sign of koth , and those huge stone steps just visible through the dusk within were the beginning of the great flight leading to upper dreamland and the enchanted wood .\\n\\nthere now began a climb of interminable length in utter blackness : made almost impossible by the monstrous size of the steps , which were fashioned for gugs , and were therefore nearly a yard high . of their number carter could form no just estimate , for he soon became so worn out that the tireless and elastic ghouls were forced to aid him . all through the endless climb there lurked the peril of detection and pursuit ; for though no gug dares lift the stone door to the forest because of the great one\\'s curse , there are no such restraints concerning the tower and the steps , and escaped ghasts are often chased , even to the very top . so sharp are the ears of gugs , that the bare feet and hands of the climbers might readily be heard when the city awoke ; and it would of course take but little time for the striding giants , accustomed from their ghast-hunts in the vaults of zin to seeing without light , to overtake their smaller and slower quarry on those cyclopean steps . it was very depressing to reflect that the silent pursuing gugs would not be heard at all , but would come very suddenly and shockingly in the dark upon the climbers . nor could the traditional fear of gugs for ghouls be depended upon in that peculiar place where the advantages lay so heavily with the gugs . there was also some peril from the furtive and venomous ghasts , which frequently hopped up onto the tower during the sleep hour of the gugs . if the gugs slept long , and the ghasts returned soon from their deed in the cavern , the scent of the climbers might easily be picked up by those loathsome and ill-disposed things ; in which case it would almost be better to be eaten by a gug .\\n\\nthen , after aeons of climbing , there came a cough from the darkness above ; and matters assumed a very grave and unexpected turn .\\n\\nit was clear that a ghast , or perhaps even more , had strayed into that tower before the coming of carter and his guides ; and it was equally clear that this peril was very close . after a breathless second the leading ghoul pushed carter to the wall and arranged his kinfolk in the best possible way , with the old slate tombstone raised for a crushing blow whenever the enemy might come in sight . ghouls can see in the dark , so the party was not as badly off as carter would have been alone . in another moment the clatter of hooves revealed the downward hopping of at least one beast , and the slab-bearing ghouls poised their weapon for a desperate blow . presently two yellowish-red eyes flashed into view , and the panting of the ghast became audible above its clattering . as it hopped down to the step above the ghouls , they wielded the ancient gravestone with prodigious force , so that there was only a wheeze and a choking before the victim collapsed in a noxious heap . there seemed to be only this one animal , and after a moment of listening the ghouls tapped carter as a signal to proceed again . as before , they were obliged to aid him ; and he was glad to leave that place of carnage where the ghast\\'s uncouth remains sprawled invisible in the blackness .\\n\\nat last the ghouls brought their companion to a halt ; and feeling above him , carter realised that the great stone trap door was reached at last . to open so vast a thing completely was not to be thought of , but the ghouls hoped to get it up just enough to slip the gravestone under as a prop , and permit carter to escape through the crack . they themselves planned to descend again and return through the city of the gugs , since their elusiveness was great , and they did not know the way overland to spectral sarkomand with its lion-guarded gate to the abyss .\\n\\nmighty was the straining of those three ghouls at the stone of the door above them , and carter helped push with as much strength as he had . they judged the edge next the top of the staircase to be the right one , and to this they bent all the force of their disreputably nourished muscles . after a few moments a crack of light appeared ; and carter , to whom that task had been entrusted , slipped the end of the old gravestone in the aperture . there now ensued a mighty heaving ; but progress was very slow , and they had of course to return to their first position every time they failed to turn the slab and prop the portal open .\\n\\nsuddenly their desperation was magnified a thousand fold by a sound on the steps below them . it was only the thumping and rattling of the slain ghast\\'s hooved body as it rolled down to lower levels ; but of all the possible causes of that body\\'s dislodgement and rolling , none was in the least reassuring . therefore , knowing the ways of gugs , the ghouls set to with something of a frenzy ; and in a surprisingly short time had the door so high that they were able to hold it still whilst carter turned the slab and left a generous opening . they now helped carter through , letting him climb up to their rubbery shoulders and later guiding his feet as he clutched at the blessed soil of the upper dreamland outside . another second and they were through themselves , knocking away the gravestone and closing the great trap door while a panting became audible beneath . because of the great one\\'s curse no gug might ever emerge from that portal , so with a deep relief and sense of repose carter lay quietly on the thick grotesque fungi of the enchanted wood while his guides squatted near in the manner that ghouls rest .\\n\\nweird as was that enchanted wood through which he had fared so long ago , it was verily a haven and a delight after those gulfs he had now left behind . there was no living denizen about , for zoogs shun the mysterious door in fear and carter at once consulted with his ghouls about their future course . to return through the tower they no longer dared , and the waking world did not appeal to them when they learned that they must pass the priests nasht and kaman-thah in the cavern of flame . so at length they decided to return through sarkomand and its gate of the abyss , though of how to get there they knew nothing . carter recalled that it lies in the valley below leng , and recalled likewise that he had seen in dylath-leen a sinister , slant-eyed old merchant reputed to trade on leng , therefore he advised the ghouls to seek out dylath-leen , crossing the fields to nir and the skai and following the river to its mouth . this they at once resolved to do , and lost no time in loping off , since the thickening of the dusk promised a full night ahead for travel . and carter shook the paws of those repulsive beasts , thanking them for their help and sending his gratitude to the beast which once was pickman ; but could not help sighing with pleasure when they left . for a ghoul is a ghoul , and at best an unpleasant companion for man . after that carter sought a forest pool and cleansed himself of the mud of nether earth , thereupon reassuming the clothes he had so carefully carried .\\n\\nit was now night in that redoubtable wood of monstrous trees , but because of the phosphorescence one might travel as well as by day ; wherefore carter set out upon the well-known route toward celephais , in ooth-nargai beyond the tanarian hills . and as he went he thought of the zebra he had left tethered to an ash-tree on ngranek in far-away oriab so many aeons ago , and wondered if any lava-gatherers had fed and released it . and he wondered , too , if he would ever return to baharna and pay for the zebra that was slain by night in those ancient ruins by yath\\'s shore , and if the old tavernkeeper would remember him . such were the thoughts that came to him in the air of the regained upper dreamland .\\n\\nbut presently his progress was halted by a sound from a very large hollow tree . he had avoided the great circle of stones , since he did not care to speak with zoogs just now ; but it appeared from the singular fluttering in that huge tree that important councils were in session elsewhere . upon drawing nearer he made out the accents of a tense and heated discussion ; and before long became conscious of matters which he viewed with the greatest concern . for a war on the cats was under debate in that sovereign assembly of zoogs . it all came from the loss of the party which had sneaked after carter to ulthar , and which the cats had justly punished for unsuitable intentions . the matter had long rankled ; and now , or at least within a month , the marshalled zoogs were about to strike the whole feline tribe in a series of surprise attacks , taking individual cats or groups of cats unawares , and giving not even the myriad cats of ulthar a proper chance to drill and mobilise . this was the plan of the zoogs , and carter saw that he must foil it before leaving upon his mighty quest .\\n\\nvery quietly therefore did randolph carter steal to the edge of the wood and send the cry of the cat over the starlit fields . and a great grimalkin in a nearby cottage took up the burden and relayed it across leagues of rolling meadow to warriors large and small , black , grey , tiger , white , yellow , and mixed , and it echoed through nir and beyond the skai even into ulthar , and ulthar\\'s numerous cats called in chorus and fell into a line of march . it was fortunate that the moon was not up , so that all the cats were on earth . swiftly and silently leaping , they sprang from every hearth and housetop and poured in a great furry sea across the plains to the edge of the wood . carter was there to greet them , and the sight of shapely , wholesome cats was indeed good for his eyes after the things he had seen and walked with in the abyss . he was glad to see his venerable friend and one-time rescuer at the head of ulthar\\'s detachment , a collar of rank around his sleek neck , and whiskers bristling at a martial angle . better still , as a sub-lieutenant in that army was a brisk young fellow who proved to be none other than the very little kitten at the inn to whom carter had given a saucer of rich cream on that long-vanished morning in ulthar . he was a strapping and promising cat now , and purred as he shook hands with his friend . his grandfather said he was doing very well in the army , and that he might well expect a captaincy after one more campaign .\\n\\ncarter now outlined the peril of the cat tribe , and was rewarded by deep-throated purrs of gratitude from all sides . consulting with the generals , he prepared a plan of instant action which involved marching at once upon the zoog council and other known strongholds of zoogs ; forestalling their surprise attacks and forcing them to terms before the mobilization of their army of invasion . thereupon without a moment\\'s loss that great ocean of cats flooded the enchanted wood and surged around the council tree and the great stone circle . flutterings rose to panic pitch as the enemy saw the newcomers and there was very little resistance among the furtive and curious brown zoogs . they saw that they were beaten in advance , and turned from thoughts of vengeance to thoughts of present self-preservation .\\n\\nhalf the cats now seated themselves in a circular formation with the captured zoogs in the centre , leaving open a lane down which were marched the additional captives rounded up by the other cats in other parts of the wood . terms were discussed at length , carter acting as interpreter , and it was decided that the zoogs might remain a free tribe on condition of rendering to the cats a large tribute of grouse , quail , and pheasants from the less fabulous parts of the forest . twelve young zoogs of noble families were taken as hostages to be kept in the temple of cats at ulthar , and the victors made it plain that any disappearances of cats on the borders of the zoog domain would be followed by consequences highly disastrous to zoogs . these matters disposed of , the assembled cats broke ranks and permitted the zoogs to slink off one by one to their respective homes , which they hastened to do with many a sullen backward glance .\\n\\nthe old cat general now offered carter an escort through the forest to whatever border he wished to reach , deeming it likely that the zoogs would harbour dire resentment against him for the frustration of their warlike enterprise . this offer he welcomed with gratitude ; not only for the safety it afforded , but because he liked the graceful companionship of cats . so in the midst of a pleasant and playful regiment , relaxed after the successful performance of its duty , randolph carter walked with dignity through that enchanted and phosphorescent wood of titan trees , talking of his quest with the old general and his grandson whilst others of the band indulged in fantastic gambols or chased fallen leaves that the wind drove among the fungi of that primeval floor . and the old cat said that he had heard much of unknown kadath in the cold waste , but did not know where it was . as for the marvellous sunset city , he had not even heard of that , but would gladly relay to carter anything he might later learn .\\n\\nhe gave the seeker some passwords of great value among the cats of dreamland , and commended him especially to the old chief of the cats in celephais , whither he was bound . that old cat , already slightly known to carter , was a dignified maltese ; and would prove highly influential in any transaction . it was dawn when they came to the proper edge of the wood , and carter bade his friends a reluctant farewell . the young sub-lieutenant he had met as a small kitten would have followed him had not the old general forbidden it , but that austere patriarch insisted that the path of duty lay with the tribe and the army . so carter set out alone over the golden fields that stretched mysterious beside a willow-fringed river , and the cats went back into the wood .\\n\\nwell did the traveller know those garden lands that lie betwixt the wood of the cerenerian sea , and blithely did he follow the singing river oukianos that marked his course . the sun rose higher over gentle slopes of grove and lawn , and heightened the colours of the thousand flowers that starred each knoll and dangle . a blessed haze lies upon all this region , wherein is held a little more of the sunlight than other places hold , and a little more of the summer\\'s humming music of birds and bees ; so that men walk through it as through a faery place , and feel greater joy and wonder than they ever afterward remember .\\n\\nby noon carter reached the jasper terraces of kiran which slope down to the river\\'s edge and bear that temple of loveliness wherein the king of ilek-vad comes from his far realm on the twilight sea once a year in a golden palanquin to pray to the god of oukianos , who sang to him in youth when he dwelt in a cottage by its banks . all of jasper is that temple , and covering an acre of ground with its walls and courts , its seven pinnacled towers , and its inner shrine where the river enters through hidden channels and the god sings softly in the night . many times the moon hears strange music as it shines on those courts and terraces and pinnacles , but whether that music be the song of the god or the chant of the cryptical priests , none but the king of ilek--vad may say ; for only he had entered the temple or seen the priests . now , in the drowsiness of day , that carven and delicate fane was silent , and carter heard only the murmur of the great stream and the hum of the birds and bees as he walked onward under the enchanted sun .\\n\\nall that afternoon the pilgrim wandered on through perfumed meadows and in the lee of gentle riverward hills bearing peaceful thatched cottages and the shrines of amiable gods carven from jasper or chrysoberyl . sometimes he walked close to the bank of oukianos and whistled to the sprightly and iridescent fish of that crystal stream , and at other times he paused amidst the whispering rushes and gazed at the great dark wood on the farther side , whose trees came down clear to the water\\'s edge . in former dreams he had seen quaint lumbering buopoths come shyly out of that wood to drink , but now he could not glimpse any . once in a while he paused to watch a carnivorous fish catch a fishing bird , which it lured to the water by showing its tempting scales in the sun , and grasped by the beak with its enormous mouth as the winged hunter sought to dart down upon it .\\n\\ntoward evening he mounted a low grassy rise and saw before him flaming in the sunset the thousand gilded spires of thran . lofty beyond belief are the alabaster walls of that incredible city , sloping inward toward the top and wrought in one solid piece by what means no man knows , for they are more ancient than memory . yet lofty as they are with their hundred gates and two hundred turrets , the clustered towers within , all white beneath their golden spires , are loftier still ; so that men on the plain around see them soaring into the sky , sometimes shining clear , sometimes caught at the top in tangles of cloud and mist , and sometimes clouded lower down with their utmost pinnacles blazing free above the vapours . and where thran\\'s gates open on the river are great wharves of marble , with ornate galleons of fragrant cedar and calamander riding gently at anchor , and strange bearded sailors sitting on casks and bales with the hieroglyphs of far places . landward beyond the walls lies the farm country , where small white cottages dream between little hills , and narrow roads with many stone bridges wind gracefully among streams and gardens .\\n\\ndown through this verdant land carter walked at evening , and saw twilight float up from the river to the marvellous golden spires of thran . and just at the hour of dusk he came to the southern gate , and was stopped by a red-robed sentry till he had told three dreams beyond belief , and proved himself a dreamer worthy to walk up thran\\'s steep mysterious streets and linger in the bazaars where the wares of the ornate galleons were sold . then into that incredible city he walked ; through a wall so thick that the gate was a tunnel , and thereafter amidst curved and undulant ways winding deep and narrow between the heavenward towers . lights shone through grated and balconied windows , and the sound of lutes and pipes stole timid from inner courts where marble fountains bubbled . carter knew his way , and edged down through darker streets to the river , where at an old sea tavern he found the captains and seamen he had known in myriad other dreams . there he bought his passage to celephais on a great green galleon , and there he stopped for the night after speaking gravely to the venerable cat of that inn , who blinked dozing before an enormous hearth and dreamed of old wars and forgotten gods .\\n\\nin the morning carter boarded the galleon bound for celephais , and sat in the prow as the ropes were cast off and the long sail down to the cerenerian sea begun . for many leagues the banks were much as they were above thran , with now and then a curious temple rising on the farther hills toward the right , and a drowsy village on the shore , with steep red roofs and nets spread in the sun . mindful of his search , carter questioned all the mariners closely about those whom they had met in the taverns of celephais , asking the names and ways of the strange men with long , narrow eyes , long-lobed ears , thin noses , and pointed chins who came in dark ships from the north and traded onyx for the carved jade and spun gold and little red singing birds of celephais . of these men the sailors knew not much , save that they talked but seldom and spread a kind of awe about them .\\n\\ntheir land , very far away , was called inquanok , and not many people cared to go thither because it was a cold twilight land , and said to be close to unpleasant leng ; although high impassable mountains towered on the side where leng was thought to lie , so that none might say whether this evil plateau with its horrible stone villages and unmentionable monastery were really there , or whether the rumour were only a fear that timid people felt in the night when those formidable barrier peaks loomed black against a rising moon . certainly , men reached leng from very different oceans . of other boundaries of inquanok those sailors had no notion , nor had they heard of the cold waste and unknown kadath save from vague unplaced report . and of the marvellous sunset city which carter sought they knew nothing at all . so the traveller asked no more of far things , but bided his time till he might talk with those strange men from cold and twilight inquanok who are the seed of such gods as carved their features on ngranek .\\n\\nlate in the day the galleon reached those bends of the river which traverse the perfumed jungles of kied . here carter wished he might disembark , for in those tropic tangles sleep wondrous palaces of ivory , lone and unbroken , where once dwelt fabulous monarchs of a land whose name is forgotten . spells of the elder ones keep those places unharmed and undecayed , for it is written that there may one day be need of them again ; and elephant caravans have glimpsed them from afar by moonlight , though none dares approach them closely because of the guardians to which their wholeness is due . but the ship swept on , and dusk hushed the hum of the day , and the first stars above blinked answers to the early fireflies on the banks as that jungle fell far behind , leaving only its fragrance as a memory that it had been . and all through the night that galleon floated on past mysteries unseen and unsuspected . once a lookout reported fires on the hills to the east , but the sleepy captain said they had better not be looked at too much , since it was highly uncertain just who or what had lit them .\\n\\nin the morning the river had broadened out greatly , and carter saw by the houses along the banks that they were close to the vast trading city of hlanith on the cerenerian sea . here the walls are of rugged granite , and the houses peakedly fantastic with beamed and plastered gables . the men of hlanith are more like those of the waking world than any others in dreamland ; so that the city is not sought except for barter , but is prized for the solid work of its artisans . the wharves of hlanith are of oak , and there the galleon made fast while the captain traded in the taverns . carter also went ashore , and looked curiously upon the rutted streets where wooden ox carts lumbered and feverish merchants cried their wares vacuously in the bazaars . the sea taverns were all close to the wharves on cobbled lanes salted with the spray of high tides , and seemed exceedingly ancient with their low black-beamed ceilings and casements of greenish bull\\'s-eye panes . ancient sailors in those taverns talked much of distant ports , and told many stories of the curious men from twilight inquanok , but had little to add to what the seamen of the galleon had told . then at last , after much unloading and loading , the ship set sail once more over the sunset sea , and the high walls and gables of hlanith grew less as the last golden light of day lent them a wonder and beauty beyond any that men had given them .\\n\\ntwo nights and two days the galleon sailed over the cerenerian sea , sighting no land and speaking but one other vessel . then near sunset of the second day there loomed up ahead the snowy peak of aran with its gingko-trees swaying on the lower slope , and carter knew that they were come to the land of ooth-nargai and the marvellous city of celephais . swiftly there came into sight the glittering minarets of that fabulous town , and the untarnished marble walls with their bronze statues , and the great stone bridge where naraxa joins the sea . then rose the gentle hills behind the town , with their groves and gardens of asphodels and the small shrines and cottages upon them ; and far in the background the purple ridge of the tanarians , potent and mystical , behind which lay forbidden ways into the waking world and toward other regions of dream .\\n\\nthe harbour was full of painted galleys , some of which were from the marble cloud-city of serannian , that lies in ethereal space beyond where the sea meets the sky , and some of which were from more substantial parts of dreamland . among these the steersman threaded his way up to the spice-fragrant wharves , where the galleon made fast in the dusk as the city\\'s million lights began to twinkle out over the water . ever new seemed this deathless city of vision , for here time has no power to tarnish or destroy . as it has always been is still the turquoise of nath-horthath , and the eighty orchid-wreathed priests are the same who builded it ten thousand years ago . shining still is the bronze of the great gates , nor are the onyx pavements ever worn or broken . and the great bronze statues on the walls look down on merchants and camel drivers older than fable , yet without one grey hair in their forked beards .\\n\\ncarter did not once seek out the temple or the palace or the citadel , but stayed by the seaward wall among traders and sailors . and when it was too late for rumours and legends he sought out an ancient tavern he knew well , and rested with dreams of the gods on unknown kadath whom he sought . the next day he searched all along the quays for some of the strange mariners of inquanok , but was told that none were now in port , their galley not being due from the north for full two weeks . he found , however , one thorabonian sailor who had been to inquanok and had worked in the onyx quarries of that twilight place ; and this sailor said there was certainly a descent to the north of the peopled region , which everybody seemed to fear and shun . the thorabonian opined that this desert led around the utmost rim of impassable peaks into leng\\'s horrible plateau , and that this was why men feared it ; though he admitted there were other vague tales of evil presences and nameless sentinels . whether or not this could be the fabled waste wherein unknown kadath stands he did not know ; but it seemed unlikely that those presences and sentinels , if indeed they existed , were stationed for nought .\\n\\non the following day carter walked up the street of the pillars to the turquoise temple and talked with the high-priest . though nath-horthath is chiefly worshipped in celephais , all the great ones are mentioned in diurnal prayers ; and the priest was reasonably versed in their moods . like atal in distant ulthar , he strongly advised against any attempts to see them ; declaring that they are testy and capricious , and subject to strange protection from the mindless other gods from outside , whose soul and messenger is the crawling chaos nyarlathotep . their jealous hiding of the marvellous sunset city shewed clearly that they did not wish carter to reach it , and it was doubtful how they would regard a guest whose object was to see them and plead before them . no man had ever found kadath in the past , and it might be just as well if none ever found it in the future . such rumours as were told about that onyx castle of the great ones were not by any means reassuring .\\n\\nhaving thanked the orchid-crowned high-priest , carter left the temple and sought out the bazaar of the sheep-butchers , where the old chief of celephais\\' cats dwelt sleek and contented . that grey and dignified being was sunning himself on the onyx pavement , and extended a languid paw as his caller approached . but when carter repeated the passwords and introductions furnished him by the old cat general of ulthar , the furry patriarch became very cordial and communicative ; and told much of the secret lore known to cats on the seaward slopes of ooth-nargai . best of all , he repeated several things told him furtively by the timid waterfront cats of celephais about the men of inquanok , on whose dark ships no cat will go .\\n\\nit seems that these men have an aura not of earth about them , though that is not the reason why no cat will sail on their ships . the reason for this is that inquanok holds shadows which no cat can endure , so that in all that cold twilight realm there is never a cheering purr or a homely mew . whether it be because of things wafted over the impassable peaks from hypothetical leng , or because of things filtering down from the chilly desert to the north , none may say ; but it remains a fact that in that far land there broods a hint of outer space which cats do not like , and to which they are more sensitive than men . therefore they will not go on the dark ships that seek the basalt quays of inquanok .\\n\\nthe old chief of the cats also told him where to find his friend king kuranes , who in carter\\'s latter dreams had reigned alternately in the rose-crystal palace of the seventy delights at celephais and in the turreted cloud-castle of sky-floating serannian . it seemed that he could no more find content in those places , but had formed a mighty longing for the english cliffs and downlands of his boyhood ; where in little dreaming villages england\\'s old songs hover at evening behind lattice windows , and where grey church towers peep lovely through the verdure of distant valleys . he could not go back to these things in the waking world because his body was dead ; but he had done the next best thing and dreamed a small tract of such countryside in the region east of the city where meadows roll gracefully up from the sea-cliffs to the foot of the tanarian hills . there he dwelt in a grey gothic manor-house of stone looking on the sea , and tried to think it was ancient trevor towers , where he was born and where thirteen generations of his forefathers had first seen the light . and on the coast nearby he had built a little cornish fishing village with steep cobbled ways , settling therein such people as had the most english faces , and seeking ever to teach them the dear remembered accents of old cornwall fishers . and in a valley not far off he had reared a great norman abbey whose tower he could see from his window , placing around it in the churchyard grey stones with the names of his ancestors carved thereon , and with a moss somewhat like old england\\'s moss . for though kuranes was a monarch in the land of dream , with all imagined pomps and marvels , splendours and beauties , ecstasies and delights , novelties and excitements at his command , he would gladly have resigned forever the whole of his power and luxury and freedom for one blessed day as a simple boy in that pure and quiet england , that ancient , beloved england which had moulded his being and of which he must always be immutably a part .\\n\\nso when carter bade that old grey chief of the cats adieu , he did not seek the terraced palace of rose crystal but walked out the eastern gate and across the daisied fields toward a peaked gable which he glimpsed through the oaks of a park sloping up to the sea-cliffs . and in time he came to a great hedge and a gate with a little brick lodge , and when he rang the bell there hobbled to admit him no robed and annointed lackey of the palace , but a small stubby old man in a smock who spoke as best he could in the quaint tones of far cornwall . and carter walked up the shady path between trees as near as possible to england\\'s trees , and clumbed the terraces among gardens set out as in queen anne\\'s time . at the door , flanked by stone cats in the old way , he was met by a whiskered butler in suitable livery ; and was presently taken to the library where kuranes , lord of ooth-nargai and the sky around serannian , sat pensive in a chair by the window looking on his little seacoast village and wishing that his old nurse would come in and scold him because he was not ready for that hateful lawn-party at the vicar\\'s , with the carriage waiting and his mother nearly out of patience .\\n\\nkuranes , clad in a dressing gown of the sort favoured by london tailors in his youth , rose eagerly to meet his guest ; for the sight of an anglo-saxon from the waking world was very dear to him , even if it was a saxon from boston , massachusetts , instead of from cornwall . and for long they talked of old times , having much to say because both were old dreamers and well versed in the wonders of incredible places . kuranes , indeed , had been out beyond the stars in the ultimate void , and was said to be the only one who had ever returned sane from such a voyage .\\n\\nat length carter brought up the subject of his quest , and asked of his host those questions he had asked of so many others . kuranes did not know where kadath was , or the marvellous sunset city ; but he did know that the great ones were very dangerous creatures to seek out , and that the other gods had strange ways of protecting them from impertinent curiosity . he had learned much of the other gods in distant parts of space , especially in that region where form does not exist , and coloured gases study the innermost secrets . the violet gas s\\'ngac had told him terrible things of the crawling chaos nyarlathotep , and had warned him never to approach the central void where the daemon sultan azathoth gnaws hungrily in the dark .\\n\\naltogether , it was not well to meddle with the elder ones ; and if they persistently denied all access to the marvellous sunset city , it were better not to seek that city .\\n\\nkuranes furthermore doubted whether his guest would profit aught by coming to the city even were he to gain it . he himself had dreamed and yearned long years for lovely celephais and the land of ooth-nargai , and for the freedom and colour and high experience of life devoid of its chains , and conventions , and stupidities . but now that he was come into that city and that land , and was the king thereof , he found the freedom and the vividness all too soon worn out , and monotonous for want of linkage with anything firm in his feelings and memories . he was a king in ooth-nargai , but found no meaning therein , and drooped always for the old familiar things of england that had shaped his youth . all his kingdom would he give for the sound of cornish church bells over the downs , and all the thousand minarets of celephais for the steep homely roofs of the village near his home . so he told his guest that the unknown sunset city might not hold quite that content he sought , and that perhaps it had better remain a glorious and half--remembered dream . for he had visited carter often in the old waking days , and knew well the lovely new england slopes that had given him birth .\\n\\nat the last , he was very certain , the seeker would long only for the early remembered scenes ; the glow of beacon hill at evening , the tall steeples and winding hill streets of quaint kingsport , the hoary gambrel roofs of ancient and witch-haunted arkham , and the blessed meads and valleys where stone walls rambled and white farmhouse gables peeped out from bowers of verdure . these things he told randolph carter , but still the seeker held to his purpose . and in the end they parted each with his own conviction , and carter went back through the bronze gate into celephais and down the street of pillars to the old sea wall , where he talked more with the mariners of far ports and waited for the dark ship from cold and twilight inquanok , whose strange-faced sailors and onyx-traders had in them the blood of the great ones .\\n\\none starlit evening when the pharos shone splendid over the harbour the longed-for ship put in , and strange-faced sailors and traders appeared one by one and group by group in the ancient taverns along the sea wall . it was very exciting to see again those living faces so like the godlike features of ngranek , but carter did not hasten to speak with the silent seamen . he did not know how much of pride and secrecy and dim supernal memory might fill those children of the great ones , and was sure it would not be wise to tell them of his quest or ask too closely of that cold desert stretching north of their twilight land . they talked little with the other folk in those ancient sea taverns ; but would gather in groups in remote comers and sing among themselves the haunting airs of unknown places , or chant long tales to one another in accents alien to the rest of dreamland . and so rare and moving were those airs and tales that one might guess their wonders from the faces of those who listened , even though the words came to common ears only as strange cadence and obscure melody .\\n\\nfor a week the strange seamen lingered in the taverns and traded in the bazaars of celephais , and before they sailed carter had taken passage on their dark ship , telling them that he was an old onyx miner and wishful to work in their quarries . that ship was very lovey and cunningly wrought , being of teakwood with ebony fittings and traceries of gold , and the cabin in which the traveller lodged had hangings of silk and velvet . one morning at the turn of the tide the sails were raised and the anchor lilted , and as carter stood on the high stern he saw the sunrise-blazing walls and bronze statues and golden minarets of ageless celephais sink into the distance , and the snowy peak of mount man grow smaller and smaller . by noon there was nothing in sight save the gentle blue of the cerenerian sea , with one painted galley afar off bound for that realm of serannian where the sea meets the sky .\\n\\nand the night came with gorgeous stars , and the dark ship steered for charles\\' wain and the little bear as they swung slowly round the pole . and the sailors sang strange songs of unknown places , and they stole off one by one to the forecastle while the wistful watchers murmured old chants and leaned over the rail to glimpse the luminous fish playing in bowers beneath the sea . carter went to sleep at midnight , and rose in the glow of a young morning , marking that the sun seemed farther south than was its wont . and all through that second day he made progress in knowing the men of the ship , getting them little by little to talk of their cold twilight land , of their exquisite onyx city , and of their fear of the high and impassable peaks beyond which leng was said to be . they told him how sorry they were that no cats would stay in the land of inquanok , and how they thought the hidden nearness of leng was to blame for it . only of the stony desert to the north they would not talk . there was something disquieting about that desert , and it was thought expedient not to admit its existence .\\n\\non later days they talked of the quarries in which carter said he was going to work . there were many of them , for all the city of inquanok was builded of onyx , whilst great polished blocks of it were traded in rinar , ogrothan , and celephais and at home with the merchants of thraa , flarnek , and kadatheron , for the beautiful wares of those fabulous ports . and far to the north , almost in the cold desert whose existence the men of inquanok did not care to admit , there was an unused quarry greater than all the rest ; from which had been hewn in forgotten times such prodigious lumps and blocks that the sight of their chiselled vacancies struck terror to all who beheld . who had mined those incredible blocks , and whither they had been transported , no man might say ; but it was thought best not to trouble that quarry , around which such inhuman memories might conceivably cling . so it was left all alone in the twilight , with only the raven and the rumoured shantak-bird to brood on its immensities . when carter heard of this quarry he was moved to deep thought , for he knew from old tales that the great ones\\' castle atop unknown kadath is of onyx .\\n\\neach day the sun wheeled lower and lower in the sky , and the mists overhead grew thicker and thicker . and in two weeks there was not any sunlight at all , but only a weird grey twilight shining through a dome of eternal cloud by day , and a cold starless phosphorescence from the under side of that cloud by night . on the twentieth day a great jagged rock in the sea was sighted from afar , the first land glimpsed since man\\'s snowy peak had dwindled behind the ship . carter asked the captain the name of that rock , but was told that it had no name and had never been sought by any vessel because of the sounds that came from it at night . and when , after dark , a dull and ceaseless howling arose from that jagged granite place , the traveller was glad that no stop had been made , and that the rock had no name . the seamen prayed and chanted till the noise was out of earshot , and carter dreamed terrible dreams within dreams in the small hours .\\n\\ntwo mornings after that there loomed far ahead and to the east a line of great grey peaks whose tops were lost in the changeless clouds of that twilight world . and at the sight of them the sailors sang glad songs , and some knelt down on the deck to pray , so that carter knew they were come to the land of inquanok and would soon be moored to the basalt quays of the great town bearing that land\\'s name . toward noon a dark coastline appeared , and before three o\\'clock there stood out against the north the bulbous domes and fantastic spires of the onyx city . rare and curious did that archaic city rise above its walls and quays , all of delicate black with scrolls , flutings , and arabesques of inlaid gold . tall and many-windowed were the houses , and carved on every side with flowers and patterns whose dark symmetries dazzled the eye with a beauty more poignant than light . some ended in swelling domes that tapered to a point , others in terraced pyramids whereon rose clustered minarets displaying every phase of strangeness and imagination . the walls were low , and pierced by frequent gates , each under a great arch rising high above the general level and capped by the head of a god chiselled with that same skill displayed in the monstrous face on distant ngranek . on a hill in the centre rose a sixteen-angled tower greater than all the rest and bearing a high pinnacled belfry resting on a flattened dome . this , the seamen said , was the temple of the elder ones , and was ruled by an old high-priest sad with inner secrets .\\n\\nat intervals the clang of a strange bell shivered over the onyx city , answered each time by a peal of mystic music made up of horns , viols , and chanting voices . and from a row of tripods on a galley round the high dome of the temple there burst flares of flame at certain moments ; for the priests and people of that city were wise in the primal mysteries , and faithful in keeping the rhythms of the great ones as set forth in scrolls older than the pnakotic manuscripts . as the ship rode past the great basalt breakwater into the harbour the lesser noises of the city grew manifest , and carter saw the slaves , sailors , and merchants on the docks . the sailors and merchants were of the strange-faced race of the gods , but the slaves were squat , slant--eyed folk said by rumour to have drifted somehow across or around the impassable peaks from the valleys beyond leng . the wharves reached wide outside the city wall and bore upon them all manner of merchandise from the galleys anchored there , while at one end were great piles of onyx both carved and uncarved awaiting shipment to the far markets of rinar , ograthan and celephais .\\n\\nit was not yet evening when the dark ship anchored beside a jutting quay of stone , and all the sailors and traders filed ashore and through the arched gate into the city . the streets of that city were paved with onyx and some of them were wide and straight whilst others were crooked and narrow . the houses near the water were lower than the rest , and bore above their curiously arched doorways certain signs of gold said to be in honour of the respective small gods that favoured each . the captain of the ship took carter to an old sea tavern where flocked the mariners of quaint countries , and promised that he would next day shew him the wonders of the twilight city , and lead him to the taverns of the onyx-miners by the northern wall . and evening fell , and little bronze lamps were lighted , and the sailors in that tavern sang songs of remote places . but when from its high tower the great bell shivered over the city , and the peal of the horns and viols and voices rose cryptical in answer thereto , all ceased their songs or tales and bowed silent till the last echo died away . for there is a wonder and a strangeness on the twilight city of inquanok , and men fear to be lax in its rites lest a doom and a vengeance lurk unsuspectedly close .\\n\\nfar in the shadows of that tavern carter saw a squat form he did not like , for it was unmistakably that of the old slant-eyed merchant he had seen so long before in the taverns of dylath-leen , who was reputed to trade with the horrible stone villages of leng which no healthy folk visit and whose evil fires are seen at night from afar , and even to have dealt with that high-priest not to be described , which wears a yellow silken mask over its face and dwells all alone in a prehistoric stone monastery . this man had seemed to shew a queer gleam of knowing when carter asked the traders of dylathleen about the cold waste and kadath ; and somehow his presence in dark and haunted inquanok , so close to the wonders of the north , was not a reassuring thing . he slipped wholly out of sight before carter could speak to him , and sailors later said that he had come with a yak caravan from some point not well determined , bearing the colossal and rich-flavoured eggs of the rumoured shantak-bird to trade for the dextrous jade goblets that merchants brought from ilarnek .\\n\\non the following morning the ship-captain led carter through the onyx streets of inquanok , dark under their twilight sky . the inlaid doors and figured house-fronts , carven balconies and crystal-paned oriels all gleamed with a sombre and polished loveliness ; and now and then a plaza would open out with black pillars , colonades , and the statues of curious beings both human and fabulous . some of the vistas down long and unbending streets , or through side alleys and over bulbous domes , spires , and arabesqued roofs , were weird and beautiful beyond words ; and nothing was more splendid than the massive heights of the great central temple of the elder ones with its sixteen carven sides , its flattened dome , and its lofty pinnacled belfry , overtopping all else , and majestic whatever its foreground . and always to the east , far beyond the city walls and the leagues of pasture land , rose the gaunt grey sides of those topless and impassable peaks across which hideous leng was said to lie .\\n\\nthe captain took carter to the mighty temple , which is set with its walled garden in a great round plaza whence the streets go as spokes from a wheel\\'s hub . the seven arched gates of that garden , each having over it a carven face like those on the city\\'s gates , are always open , and the people roam reverently at will down the tiled paths and through the little lanes lined with grotesque termini and the shrines of modest gods . and there are fountains , pools , and basins there to reflect the frequent blaze of the tripods on the high balcony , all of onyx and having in them small luminous fish taken by divers from the lower bowers of ocean . when the deep clang from the temple belfry shivers over the garden and the city , and the answer of the horns and viols and voices peals out from the seven lodges by the garden gates , there issue from the seven doors of the temple long columns of masked and hooded priests in black , bearing at arm\\'s length before them great golden bowls from which a curious steam rises . and all the seven columns strut peculiarly in single file , legs thrown far forward without bending the knees , down the walks that lead to the seven lodges , wherein they disappear and do not appear again . it is said that subterrene paths connect the lodges with the temple , and that the long files of priests return through them ; nor is it unwhispered that deep flights of onyx steps go down to mysteries that are never told . but only a few are those who hint that the priests in the masked and hooded columns are not human beings .\\n\\ncarter did not enter the temple , because none but the veiled king is permitted to do that . but before he left the garden the hour of the bell came , and he heard the shivering clang deafening above him , and the wailing of the horns and viols and voices loud from the lodges by the gates . and down the seven great walks stalked the long files of bowl-bearing priests in their singular way , giving to the traveller a fear which human priests do not often give . when the last of them had vanished he left that garden , noting as he did so a spot on the pavement over which the bowls had passed . even the ship-captain did not like that spot , and hurried him on toward the hill whereon the veiled king\\'s palace rises many-domed and marvellous .\\n\\nthe ways to the onyx palace are steep and narrow , all but the broad curving one where the king and his companions ride on yaks or in yak--drawn chariots . carter and his guide climbed up an alley that was all steps , between inlaid walls hearing strange signs in gold , and under balconies and oriels whence sometimes floated soft strains of music or breaths of exotic fragrance . always ahead loomed those titan walls , mighty buttresses , and clustered and bulbous domes for which the veiled king\\'s palace is famous ; and at length they passed under a great black arch and emerged in the gardens of the monarch\\'s pleasure . there carter paused in faintness at so much beauty , for the onyx terraces and colonnaded walks , the gay porterres and delicate flowering trees espaliered to golden lattices , the brazen urns and tripods with cunning bas-reliefs , the pedestalled and almost breathing statues of veined black marble , the basalt-bottomed lagoon\\'s tiled fountains with luminous fish , the tiny temples of iridescent singing birds atop carven columns , the marvellous scrollwork of the great bronze gates , and the blossoming vines trained along every inch of the polished walls all joined to form a sight whose loveliness was beyond reality , and half-fabulous even in the land of dreams . there it shimmered like a vision under that grey twilight sky , with the domed and fretted magnificence of the palace ahead , and the fantastic silhouette of the distant impassable peaks on the right . and ever the small birds and the fountains sang , while the perfume of rare blossoms spread like a veil over that incredible garden . no other human presence was there , and carter was glad it was so . then they turned and descended again the onyx alley of steps , for the palace itself no visitor may enter ; and it is not well to look too long and steadily at the great central dome , since it is said to house the archaic father of all the rumoured shantak-birds , and to send out queer dreams to the curious .\\n\\nafter that the captain took carter to the north quarter of the town , near the gate of the caravans , where are the taverns of the yak--merchants and the onyx-miners . and there , in a low-ceiled inn of quarrymen , they said farewell ; for business called the captain whilst carter was eager to talk with miners about the north . there were many men in that inn , and the traveller was not long in speaking to some of them ; saying that he was an old miner of onyx , and anxious to know somewhat of inquanok\\'s quarries . but all that he learned was not much more than he knew before , for the miners were timid and evasive about the cold desert to the north and the quarry that no man visits . they had fears of fabled emissaries from around the mountains where leng is said to lie , and of evil presences and nameless sentinels far north among the scattered rocks . and they whispered also that the rumoured shantak-birds are no wholesome things ; it being . indeed for the best that no man has ever truly seen one (for that fabled father of shantaks in the king\\'s dome is fed in the dark) .\\n\\nthe next day , saying that he wished to look over all the various mines for himself and to visit the scattered farms and quaint onyx villages of inquanok , carter hired a yak and stuffed great leathern saddle-bags for a journey . beyond the gate of the caravans the road lay straight betwixt tilled fields , with many odd farmhouses crowned by low domes . at some of these houses the seeker stopped to ask questions ; once finding a host so austere and reticent , and so full of an unplaced majesty like to that in the huge features on ngranek , that he felt certain he had come at last upon one of the great ones themselves , or upon one with full nine-tenths of their blood , dwelling amongst men . and to that austere and reticent cotter he was careful to speak very well of the gods , and to praise all the blessings they had ever accorded him .\\n\\nthat night carter camped in a roadside meadow beneath a great lygath--tree to which he tied his yak , and in the morning resumed his northward pilgrimage . at about ten o\\'clock he reached the small-domed village of urg , where traders rest and miners tell their tales , and paused in its taverns till noon . it is here that the great caravan road turns west toward selarn , but carter kept on north by the quarry road . all the afternoon he followed that rising road , which was somewhat narrower than the great highway , and which now led through a region with more rocks than tilled fields . and by evening the low hills on his left had risen into sizable black cliffs , so that he knew he was close to the mining country . all the while the great gaunt sides of the impassable mountains towered afar off at his right , and the farther he went , the worse tales he heard of them from the scattered farmers and traders and drivers of lumbering onyx-carts along the way .\\n\\non the second night he camped in the shadow of a large black crag , tethering his yak to a stake driven in the ground . he observed the greater phosphorescence of the clouds at his northerly point , and more than once thought he saw dark shapes outlined against them . and on the third morning he came in sight of the first onyx quarry , and greeted the men who there laboured with picks and chisels . before evening he had passed eleven quarries ; the land being here given over altogether to onyx cliffs and boulders , with no vegetation at all , but only great rocky fragments scattered about a floor of black earth , with the grey impassable peaks always rising gaunt and sinister on his right . the third night he spent in a camp of quarry men whose flickering fires cast weird reflections on the polished cliffs to the west . and they sang many songs and told many tales , shewing such strange knowledge of the olden days and the habits of gods that carter could see they held many latent memories of their sires the great ones . they asked him whither he went , and cautioned him not to go too far to the north ; but he replied that he was seeking new cliffs of onyx , and would take no more risks than were common among prospectors . in the morning he bade them adieu and rode on into the darkening north , where they had warned him he would find the feared and unvisited quarry whence hands older than men\\'s hands had wrenched prodigious blocks . but he did not like it when , turning back to wave a last farewell , he thought he saw approaching the camp that squat and evasive old merchant with slanting eyes , whose conjectured traffick with leng was the gossip of distant dylath-leen .\\n\\nafter two more quarries the inhabited part of inquanok seemed to end , and the road narrowed to a steeply rising yak-path among forbidding black cliffs . always on the right towered the gaunt and distant peaks , and as carter climbed farther and farther into this untraversed realm he found it grew darker and colder . soon he perceived that there were no prints of feet or hooves on the black path beneath , and realised that he was indeed come into strange and deserted ways of elder time . once in a while a raven would croak far overhead , and now and then a flapping behind some vast rock would make him think uncomfortably of the rumoured shantak-bird . but in the main he was alone with his shaggy steed , and it troubled him to observe that this excellent yak became more and more reluctant to advance , and more and more disposed to snort affrightedly at any small noise along the route .\\n\\nthe path now contracted between sable and glistening walls , and began to display an even greater steepness than before . it was a bad footing , and the yak often slipped on the stony fragments strewn thickly about . in two hours carter saw ahead a definite crest , beyond which was nothing but dull grey sky , and blessed the prospect of a level or downward course . to reach this crest , however , was no easy task ; for the way had grown nearly perpendicular , and was perilous with loose black gravel and small stones . eventually carter dismounted and led his dubious yak ; pulling very hard when the animal balked or stumbled , and keeping his own footing as best he might . then suddenly he came to the top and saw beyond , and gasped at what he saw .\\n\\nthe path indeed led straight ahead and slightly down , with the same lines of high natural walls as before ; but on the left hand there opened out a monstrous space , vast acres in extent , where some archaic power had riven and rent the native cliffs of onyx in the form of a giant\\'s quarry . far back into the solid precipice ran that cyclopean gouge , and deep down within earth\\'s bowels its lower delvings yawned . it was no quarry of man , and the concave sides were scarred with great squares , yards wide , which told of the size of the blocks once hewn by nameless hands and chisels . high over its jagged rim huge ravens flapped and croaked , and vague whirrings in the unseen depths told of bats or urhags or less mentionable presences haunting the endless blackness . there carter stood in the narrow way amidst the twilight with the rocky path sloping down before him ; tall onyx cliffs on his right that led on as far as he could see and tall cliffs on the left chopped off just ahead to make that terrible and unearthly quarry .\\n\\nall at once the yak uttered a cry and burst from his control , leaping past him and darting on in a panic till it vanished down the narrow slope toward the north . stones kicked by its flying hooves fell over the brink of the quarry and lost themselves in the dark without any sound of striking bottom ; but carter ignored the perils of that scanty path as he raced breathlessly after the flying steed . soon the left--behind cliffs resumed their course , making the way once more a narrow lane ; and still the traveller leaped on after the yak whose great wide prints told of its desperate flight .\\n\\nonce he thought he heard the hoofbeats of the frightened beast , and doubled his speed from this encouragement . he was covering miles , and little by little the way was broadening in front till he knew he must soon emerge on the cold and dreaded desert to the north . the gaunt grey flanks of the distant impassable peaks were again visible above the right-hand crags , and ahead were the rocks and boulders of an open space which was clearly a foretaste of the dark arid limitless plain . and once more those hoofbeats sounded in his ears , plainer than before , but this time giving terror instead of encouragement because he realised that they were not the frightened hoofbeats of his fleeing yak . the beats were ruthless and purposeful , and they were behind him .\\n\\ncarter\\'s pursuit of the yak became now a flight from an unseen thing , for though he dared not glance over his shoulder he felt that the presence behind him could be nothing wholesome or mentionable . his yak must have heard or felt it first , and he did not like to ask himself whether it had followed him from the haunts of men or had floundered up out of that black quarry pit . meanwhile the cliffs had been left behind , so that the oncoming night fell over a great waste of sand and spectral rocks wherein all paths were lost . he could not see the hoofprints of his yak , but always from behind him there came that detestable clopping ; mingled now and then with what he fancied were titanic flappings and whirrings . that he was losing ground seemed unhappily clear to him , and he knew he was hopelessly lost in this broken and blasted desert of meaningless rocks and untravelled sands . only those remote and impassable peaks on the right gave him any sense of direction , and even they were less clear as the grey twilight waned and the sickly phosphorescence of the clouds took its place .\\n\\nthen dim and misty in the darkling north before him he glimpsed a terrible thing . he had thought it for some moments a range of black mountains , but now he saw it was something more . the phosphorescence of the brooding clouds shewed it plainly , and even silhouetted parts of it as vapours glowed behind . how distant it was he could not tell , but it must have been very far . it was thousands of feet high , stretching in a great concave arc from the grey impassable peaks to the unimagined westward spaces , and had once indeed been a ridge of mighty onyx hills . but now these hills were hills no more , for some hand greater than man\\'s had touched them . silent they squatted there atop the world like wolves or ghouls , crowned with clouds and mists and guarding the secrets of the north forever . all in a great half circle they squatted , those dog-like mountains carven into monstrous watching statues , and their right hands were raised in menace against mankind .\\n\\nit was only the flickering light of the clouds that made their mitred double heads seem to move , but as carter stumbled on he saw arise from their shadowy caps great forms whose motions were no delusion . winged and whirring , those forms grew larger each moment , and the traveller knew his stumbling was at an end . they were not any birds or bats known elsewhere on earth or in dreamland , for they were larger than elephants and had heads like a horse\\'s . carter knew that they must be the shantak-birds of ill rumour , and wondered no more what evil guardians and nameless sentinels made men avoid the boreal rock desert . and as he stopped in final resignation he dared at last to look behind him , where indeed was trotting the squat slant-eyed trader of evil legend , grinning astride a lean yak and leading on a noxious horde of leering shantaks to whose wings still clung the rime and nitre of the nether pits .\\n\\ntrapped though he was by fabulous and hippocephalic winged nightmares that pressed around in great unholy circles , randolph carter did not lose consciousness . lofty and horrible those titan gargoyles towered above him , while the slant-eyed merchant leaped down from his yak and stood grinning before the captive . then the man motioned carter to mount one of the repugnant shantaks , helping him up as his judgement struggled with his loathing . it was hard work ascending , for the shantak-bird has scales instead of feathers , and those scales are very slippery . once he was seated , the slant-eyed man hopped up behind him , leaving the lean yak to be led away northward toward the ring of carven mountains by one of the incredible bird colossi .\\n\\nthere now followed a hideous whirl through frigid space , endlessly up and eastward toward the gaunt grey flanks of those impassable mountains beyond which leng was said to be . far above the clouds they flew , till at last there lay beneath them those fabled summits which the folk of inquanok have never seen , and which lie always in high vortices of gleaming mist . carter beheld them very plainly as they passed below , and saw upon their topmost peaks strange caves which made him think of those on ngranek ; but he did not question his captor about these things when he noticed that both the man and the horse--headed shantak appeared oddly fearful of them , hurrying past nervously and shewing great tension until they were left far in the rear .\\n\\nthe shantak now flew lower , revealing beneath the canopy of cloud a grey barren plain whereon at great distances shone little feeble fires . as they descended there appeared at intervals lone huts of granite and bleak stone villages whose tiny windows glowed with pallid light . and there came from those huts and villages a shrill droning of pipes and a nauseous rattle of crotala which proved at once that inquanok\\'s people are right in their geographic rumours . for travellers have heard such sounds before , and know that they float only from the cold desert plateau which healthy folk never visit ; that haunted place of evil and mystery which is leng .\\n\\naround the feeble fires dark forms were dancing , and carter was curious as to what manner of beings they might be ; for no healthy folk have ever been to leng , and the place is known only by its fires and stone huts as seen from afar . very slowly and awkwardly did those forms leap , and with an insane twisting and bending not good to behold ; so that carter did not wonder at the monstrous evil imputed to them by vague legend , or the fear in which all dreamland holds their abhorrent frozen plateau . as the shantak flew lower , the repulsiveness of the dancers became tinged with a certain hellish familiarity ; and the prisoner kept straining his eyes and racking his memory for clues to where he had seen such creatures before .\\n\\nthey leaped as though they had hooves instead of feet , and seemed to wear a sort of wig or headpiece with small horns . of other clothing they had none , but most of them were quite furry . behind they had dwarfish tails , and when they glanced upward he saw the excessive width of their mouths . then he knew what they were , and that they did not wear any wigs or headpieces after all . for the cryptic folk of leng were of one race with the uncomfortable merchants of the black galleys that traded rubies at dylath-leen ; those not quite human merchants who are the slaves of the monstrous moon-things ! they were indeed the same dark folk who had shanghaied carter on their noisome galley so long ago , and whose kith he had seen driven in herds about the unclean wharves of that accursed lunar city , with the leaner ones toiling and the fatter ones taken away in crates for other needs of their polypous and amorphous masters . now he saw where such ambiguous creatures came from , and shuddered at the thought that leng must be known to these formless abominations from the moon .\\n\\nbut the shantak flew on past the fires and the stone huts and the less than human dancers , and soared over sterile hills of grey granite and dim wastes of rock and ice and snow . day came , and the phosphorescence of low clouds gave place to the misty twilight of that northern world , and still the vile bird winged meaningly through the cold and silence . at times the slant-eyed man talked with his steed in a hateful and guttural language , and the shantak would answer with tittering tones that rasped like the scratching of ground glass . ali this while the land was getting higher , and finally they came to a wind-swept table--land which seemed the very roof of a blasted and tenantless world . there , all alone in the hush and the dusk and the cold , rose the uncouth stones of a squat windowless building , around which a circle of crude monoliths stood . in all this arrangement there was nothing human , and carter surmised from old tales that he was indeed come to that most dreadful and legendary of all places , the remote and prehistoric monastery wherein dwells uncompanioned the high-priest not to be described , which wears a yellow silken mask over its face and prays to the other gods and their crawling chaos nyarlathotep .\\n\\nthe loathsome bird now settled to the ground , and the slant-eyed man hopped down and helped his captive alight . of the purpose of his seizure carter now felt very sure ; for clearly the slant-eyed merchant was an agent of the darker powers , eager to drag before his masters a mortal whose presumption had aimed at the finding of unknown kadath and the saying of a prayer before the faces of the great ones in their onyx castle . it seemed likely that this merchant had caused his former capture by the slaves of the moon-things in dylath-leen , and that he now meant to do what the rescuing cats had baffled ; taking the victim to some dread rendezvous with monstrous nyarlathotep and telling with what boldness the seeking of unknown kadath had been tried . leng and the cold waste north of inquanok must be close to the other gods , and there the passes to kadath are well guarded .\\n\\nthe slant-eyed man was small , but the great hippocephalic bird was there to see he was obeyed ; so carter followed where he led , and passed within the circle of standing rocks and into the low arched doorway of that windowless stone monastery . there were no lights inside , but the evil merchant lit a small clay lamp bearing morbid bas-reliefs and prodded his prisoner on through mazes of narrow winding corridors . on the walls of the corridors were printed frightful scenes older than history , and in a style unknown to the archaeologists of earth . after countless aeons their pigments were brilliant still , for the cold and dryness of hideous leng keep alive many primal things . carter saw them fleetingly in the rays of that dim and moving lamp , and shuddered at the tale they told .\\n\\nthrough those archaic frescoes leng\\'s annals stalked ; and the horned , hooved , and wide-mouthed almost-humans danced evilly amidst forgotten cities . there were scenes of old wars , wherein leng\\'s almost-humans fought with the bloated purple spiders of the neighbouring vales ; and there were scenes also of the coming of the black galleys from the moon , and of the submission of leng\\'s people to the polypous and amorphous blasphemies that hopped and floundered and wriggled out of them . those slippery greyish-white blasphemies they worshipped as gods , nor ever complained when scores of their best and fatted males were taken away in the black galleys . the monstrous moon-beasts made their camp on a jagged isle in the sea , and carter could tell from the frescoes that this was none other than the lone nameless rock he had seen when sailing to inquanok ; that grey accursed rock which inquanok\\'s seamen shun , and from which vile howlings reverberate all through the night .\\n\\nand in those frescoes was shewn the great seaport and capital of the almost-humans ; proud and pillared betwixt the cliffs and the basalt wharves , and wondrous with high fanes and carven places . great gardens and columned streets led from the cliffs and from each of the six sphinx-crowned gates to a vast central plaza , and in that plaza was a pair of winged colossal lions guarding the top of a subterrene staircase . again and again were those huge winged lions shewn , their mighty flanks of diarite glistening in the grey twilight of the day and the cloudy phosphorescence of the night . and as carter stumbled past their frequent and repeated pictures it came to him at last what indeed they were , and what city it was that the almost-humans had ruled so anciently before the coming of the black galleys . there could be no mistake , for the legends of dreamland are generous and profuse . indubitably that primal city was no less a place than storied sarkomand , whose ruins had bleached for a million years before the first true human saw the light , and whose twin titan lions guard eternally the steps that lead down from dreamland to the great abyss .\\n\\nother views shewed the gaunt grey peaks dividing leng from inquanok , and the monstrous shantak-birds that build nests on the ledges half way up . and they shewed likewise the curious caves near the very topmost pinnacles , and how even the boldest of the shantaks fly screaming away from them . carter had seen those caves when he passed over them , and had noticed their likeness to the caves on ngranek . now he knew that the likeness was more than a chance one , for in these pictures were shewn their fearsome denizens ; and those bat-wings , curving horns , barbed tails , prehensile paws and rubbery bodies were not strange to him . he had met those silent , flitting and clutching creatures before ; those mindless guardians of the great abyss whom even the great ones fear , and who own not nyarlathotep but hoary nodens as their lord . for they were the dreaded night-gaunts , who never laugh or smile because they have no faces , and who flop unendingly in the dark betwixt the vale of pnath and the passes to the outer world .\\n\\nthe slant-eyed merchant had now prodded carter into a great domed space whose walls were carved in shocking bas-reliefs , and whose centre held a gaping circular pit surrounded by six malignly stained stone altars in a ring . there was no light in this vast evil-smelling crypt , and the small lamp of the sinister merchant shone so feebly that one could grasp details only little by little . at the farther end was a high stone dais reached by five steps ; and there on a golden throne sat a lumpish figure robed in yellow silk figured with red and having a yellow silken mask over its face . to this being the slant--eyed man made certain signs with his hands , and the lurker in the dark replied by raising a disgustingly carven flute of ivory in silk--covered paws and blowing certain loathsome sounds from beneath its flowing yellow mask . this colloquy went on for some time , and to carter there was something sickeningly familiar in the sound of that flute and the stench of the malodorous place . it made him think of a frightful red-litten city and of the revolting procession that once filed through it ; of that , and of an awful climb through lunar countryside beyond , before the rescuing rush of earth\\'s friendly cats . he knew that the creature on the dais was without doubt the high--priest not to be described , of which legend whispers such fiendish and abnormal possibilities , but he feared to think just what that abhorred high-priest might be .\\n\\nthen the figured silk slipped a trifle from one of the greyish-white paws , and carter knew what the noisome high-priest was . and in that hideous second , stark fear drove him to something his reason would never have dared to attempt , for in all his shaken consciousness there was room only for one frantic will to escape from what squatted on that golden throne . he knew that hopeless labyrinths of stone lay betwixt him and the cold table-land outside , and that even on that table-land the noxious shantek still waited ; yet in spite of all this there was in his mind only the instant need to get away from that wriggling , silk-robed monstrosity .\\n\\nthe slant-eyed man had set the curious lamp upon one of the high and wickedly stained altar-stones by the pit , and had moved forward somewhat to talk to the high-priest with his hands . carter , hitherto wholly passive , now gave that man a terrific push with all the wild strength of fear , so that the victim toppled at once into that gaping well which rumour holds to reach down to the hellish vaults of zin where gugs hunt ghasts in the dark . in almost the same second he seized the lamp from the altar and darted out into the frescoed labyrinths , racing this way and that as chance determined and trying not to think of the stealthy padding of shapeless paws on the stones behind him , or of the silent wrigglings and crawlings which must be going on back there in lightless corridors .\\n\\nafter a few moments he regretted his thoughtless haste , and wished he had tried to follow backward the frescoes he had passed on the way in . true , they were so confused and duplicated that they could not have done him much good , but he wished none the less he had made the attempt . those he now saw were even more horrible than those he had seen then , and he knew he was not in the corridors leading outside . in time he became quite sure he was not followed , and slackened his pace somewhat ; but scarce had he breathed in half relief when a new peril beset him . his lamp was waning , and he would soon be in pitch blackness with no means of sight or guidance .\\n\\nwhen the light was all gone he groped slowly in the dark , and prayed to the great ones for such help as they might afford . at times he felt the stone floor sloping up or down , and once he stumbled over a step for which no reason seemed to exist . the farther he went the damper it seemed to be , and when he was able to feel a junction or the mouth of a side passage he always chose the way which sloped downward the least . he believed , though , that his general course was down ; and the vault-like smell and incrustations on the greasy walls and floor alike warned him he was burrowing deep in leng\\'s unwholesome table-land . but there was not any warning of the thing which came at last ; only the thing itself with its terror and shock and breath-taking chaos . one moment he was groping slowly over the slippery floor of an almost level place , and the next he was shooting dizzily downward in the dark through a burrow which must have been well-nigh vertical .\\n\\nof the length of that hideous sliding he could never be sure , but it seemed to take hours of delirious nausea and ecstatic frenzy . then he realized he was still , with the phosphorescent clouds of a northern night shining sickly above him . all around were crumbling walls and broken columns , and the pavement on which he lay was pierced by straggling grass and wrenched asunder by frequent shrubs and roots . behind him a basalt cliff rose topless and perpendicular ; its dark side sculptured into repellent scenes , and pierced by an arched and carven entrance to the inner blacknesses out of which he had come . ahead stretched double rows of pillars , and the fragments and pedestals of pillars , that spoke of a broad and bygone street ; and from the urns and basins along the way he knew it had been a great street of gardens . far off at its end the pillars spread to mark a vast round plaza , and in that open circle there loomed gigantic under the lurid night clouds a pair of monstrous things . huge winged lions of diarite they were , with blackness and shadow between them . full twenty feet they reared their grotesque and unbroken heads , and snarled derisive on the ruins around them . and carter knew right well what they must be , for legend tells of only one such twain . they were the changeless guardians of the great abyss , and these dark ruins were in truth primordial sarkomand .\\n\\ncarter\\'s first act was to close and barricade the archway in the cliff with fallen blocks and odd debris that lay around . he wished no follower from leng\\'s hateful monastery , for along the way ahead would lurk enough of other dangers . of how to get from sarkomand to the peopled parts of dreamland he knew nothing at all ; nor could he gain much by descending to the grottoes of the ghouls , since he knew they were no better informed than he . the three ghouls which had helped him through the city of gugs to the outer world had not known how to reach sarkomand in their journey back , but had planned to ask old traders in dylath-leen . he did not like to think of going again to the subterrene world of gugs and risking once more that hellish tower of koth with its cyclopean steps leading to the enchanted wood , yet he felt he might have to try this course if all else failed . over leng\\'s plateau past the lone monastery he dared not go unaided ; for the high-priest\\'s emissaries must be many , while at the journey\\'s end there would no doubt be the shantaks and perhaps other things to deal with . if he could get a boat he might sail back to inquanok past the jagged and hideous rock in the sea , for the primal frescoes in the monastery labyrinth had shewn that this frightful place lies not far from sarkomand\\'s basalt quays . but to find a boat in this aeon-deserted city was no probable thing , and it did not appear likely that he could ever make one .\\n\\nsuch were the thoughts of randolph carter when a new impression began beating upon his mind . all this while there had stretched before him the great corpse-like width of fabled sarkomand with its black broken pillars and crumbling sphinx-crowned gates and titan stones and monstrous winged lions against the sickly glow of those luminous night clouds . now he saw far ahead and on the right a glow that no clouds could account for , and knew he was not alone in the silence of that dead city . the glow rose and fell fitfully , flickering with a greenish tinge which did not reassure the watcher . and when he crept closer , down the littered street and through some narrow gaps between tumbled walls , he perceived that it was a campfire near the wharves with many vague forms clustered darkly around it ; and a lethal odour hanging heavily over all . beyond was the oily lapping of the harbour water with a great ship riding at anchor , and carter paused in stark terror when he saw that the ship was indeed one of the dreaded black galleys from the moon .\\n\\nthen , just as he was about to creep back from that detestable flame , he saw a stirring among the vague dark forms and heard a peculiar and unmistakable sound . it was the frightened meeping of a ghoul , and in a moment it had swelled to a veritable chorus of anguish . secure as he was in the shadow of monstrous ruins , carter allowed his curiosity to conquer his fear , and crept forward again instead of retreating . once in crossing an open street he wriggled worm-like on his stomach , and in another place he had to rise to his feet to avoid making a noise among heaps of fallen marble . but always he succeeded in avoiding discovery , so that in a short time he had found a spot behind a titan pillar where he could watch the whole green-litten scene of action . there around a hideous fire fed by the obnoxious stems of lunar fungi , there squatted a stinking circle of the toadlike moonbeasts and their almost-human slaves . some of these slaves were heating curious iron spears in the leaping flames , and at intervals applying their white--hot points to three tightly trussed prisoners that lay writhing before the leaders of the party . from the motions of their tentacles carter could see that the blunt-snouted moonbeasts were enjoying the spectacle hugely , and vast was his horror when he suddenly recognised the frantic meeping and knew that the tortured ghouls were none other than the faithful trio which had guided him safely from the abyss , and had thereafter set out from the enchanted wood to find sarkomand and the gate to their native deeps .\\n\\nthe number of malodorous moonbeasts about that greenish fire was very great , and carter saw that he could do nothing now to save his former allies . of how the ghouls had been captured he could not guess ; but fancied that the grey toadlike blasphemies had heard them inquire in dylath-leen concerning the way to sarkomand and had not wished them to approach so closely the hateful plateau of leng and the high-priest not to be described . for a moment he pondered on what he ought to do , and recalled how near he was to the gate of the ghouls\\' black kingdom . clearly it was wisest to creep east to the plaza of twin lions and descend at once to the gulf , where assuredly he would meet no horrors worse than those above , and where he might soon find ghouls eager to rescue their brethren and perhaps to wipe out the moonbeasts from the black galley . it occurred to him that the portal , like other gates to the abyss , might be guarded by flocks of night-gaunts ; but he did not fear these faceless creatures now . he had learned that they are bound by solemn treaties with the ghouls , and the ghoul which was pickman had taught him how to glibber a password they understood .\\n\\nso carter began another silent crawl through the ruins , edging slowly toward the great central plaza and the winged lions . it was ticklish work , but the moonbeasts were pleasantly busy and did not hear the slight noises which he twice made by accident among the scattered stones . at last he reached the open space and picked his way among the stunned trees and vines that had grown up therein . the gigantic lions loomed terrible above him in the sickly glow of the phosphorescent night clouds , but he manfully persisted toward them and presently crept round to their faces , knowing it was on that side he would find the mighty darkness which they guard . ten feet apart crouched the mocking-faced beasts of diarite , brooding on cyclopean pedestals whose sides were chiselled in fearsome bas-reliefs . betwixt them was a tiled court with a central space which had once been railed with balusters of onyx . midway in this space a black well opened , and carter soon saw that he had indeed reached the yawning gulf whose crusted and mouldy stone steps lead down to the crypts of nightmare .\\n\\nterrible is the memory of that dark descent in which hours wore themselves away whilst carter wound sightlessly round and round down a fathomless spiral of steep and slippery stairs . so worn and narrow were the steps , and so greasy with the ooze of inner earth , that the climber never quite knew when to expect a breathless fall and hurtling down to the ultimate pits ; and he was likewise uncertain just when or how the guardian night-gaunts would suddenly pounce upon him , if indeed there were any stationed in this primeval passage . all about him was a stifling odour of nether gulfs , and he felt that the air of these choking depths was not made for mankind . in time he became very numb and somnolent , moving more from automatic impulse than from reasoned will ; nor did he realize any change when he stopped moving altogether as something quietly seized him from behind . he was flying very rapidly through the air before a malevolent tickling told him that the rubbery night-gaunts had performed their duty .\\n\\nawaked to the fact that he was in the cold , damp clutch of the faceless flutterers , carter remembered the password of the ghouls and glibbered it as loudly as he could amidst the wind and chaos of flight . mindless though night-gaunts are said to be , the effect was instantaneous ; for all tickling stopped at once , and the creatures hastened to shift their captive to a more comfortable position . thus encouraged carter ventured some explanations ; telling of the seizure and torture of three ghouls by the moonbeasts , and of the need of assembling a party to rescue them . the night-gaunts , though inarticulate , seemed to understand what was said ; and shewed greater haste and purpose in their flight . suddenly the dense blackness gave place to the grey twilight of inner earth , and there opened up ahead one of those flat sterile plains on which ghouls love to squat and gnaw . scattered tombstones and osseous fragments told of the denizens of that place ; and as carter gave a loud meep of urgent summons , a score of burrows emptied forth their leathery , dog-like tenants . the night-gaunts now flew low and set their passenger upon his feet , afterward withdrawing a little and forming a hunched semicircle on the ground while the ghouls greeted the newcomer .\\n\\ncarter glibbered his message rapidly and explicitly to the grotesque company , and four of them at once departed through different burrows to spread the news to others and gather such troops as might be available for a rescue . after a long wait a ghoul of some importance appeared , and made significant signs to the night-gaunts , causing two of the latter to fly off into the dark . thereafter there were constant accessions to the hunched flock of night-gaunts on the plain , till at length the slimy soil was fairly black with them . meanwhile fresh ghouls crawled out of the burrows one by one , all glibbering excitedly and forming in crude battle array not far from the huddled night--gaunts . in time there appeared that proud and influential ghoul which was once the artist richard pickman of boston , and to him carter glibbered a very full account of what had occurred . the erstwhile pickman , pleased to greet his ancient friend again , seemed very much impressed , and held a conference with other chiefs a little apart from the growing throng .\\n\\nfinally , after scanning the ranks with care , the assembled chiefs all meeped in unison and began glibbering orders to the crowds of ghouls and night-gaunts . a large detachment of the horned flyers vanished at once , while the rest grouped themselves two by two on their knees with extended forelegs , awaiting the approach of the ghouls one by one . as each ghoul reached the pair of night-gaunts to which he was assigned , he was taken up and borne away into the blackness ; till at last the whole throng had vanished save for carter , pickman , and the other chiefs , and a few pairs of night-gaunts . pickman explained that night--gaunts are the advance guard and battle steeds of the ghouls , and that the army was issuing forth to sarkomand to deal with the moonbeasts . then carter and the ghoulish chiefs approached the waiting bearers and were taken up by the damp , slippery paws . another moment and all were whirling in wind and darkness ; endlessly up , up , up to the gate of the winged and the special ruins of primal sarkomand .\\n\\nwhen , after a great interval , carter saw again the sickly light of sarkomand\\'s nocturnal sky , it was to behold the great central plaza swarming with militant ghouls and night-gaunts . day , he felt sure , must be almost due ; but so strong was the army that no surprise of the enemy would be needed . the greenish flare near the wharves still glimmered faintly , though the absence of ghoulish meeping shewed that the torture of the prisoners was over for the nonce . softly glibbering directions to their steeds and to the flock of riderless night-gaunts ahead , the ghouls presently rose in wide whirring columns and swept on over the bleak ruins toward the evil flame . carter was now beside pickman in the front rank of ghouls , and saw as they approached the noisome camp that the moonbeasts were totally unprepared . the three prisoners lay bound and inert beside the fire , while their toadlike captors slumped drowsily about in no certain order . the almost-human slaves were asleep , even the sentinels shirking a duty which in this realm must have seemed to them merely perfunctory .\\n\\nthe final swoop of the night-gaunts and mounted ghouls was very sudden , each of the greyish toadlike blasphemies and their almost-human slaves being seized by a group of night-gaunts before a sound was made . the moonbeasts , of course , were voiceless ; and even the slaves had little chance to scream before rubbery paws choked them into silence . horrible were the writhings of those great jellyfish abnormalities as the sardonic night-gaunts clutched them , but nothing availed against the strength of those black prehensile talons . when a moonbeast writhed too violently , a night-gaunt would seize and pull its quivering pink tentacles ; which seemed to hurt so much that the victim would cease its struggles . carter expected to see much slaughter , but found that the ghouls were far subtler in their plans . they glibbered certain simple orders to the night-gaunts which held the captives , trusting the rest to instinct ; and soon the hapless creatures were borne silently away into the great abyss , to be distributed impartially amongst the dholes , gugs , ghasts and other dwellers in darkness whose modes of nourishment are not painless to their chosen victims . meanwhile the three bound ghouls had been released and consoled by their conquering kinsfolk , whilst various parties searched the neighborhood for possible remaining moonbeasts , and boarded the evil-smelling black galley at the wharf to make sure that nothing had escaped the general defeat . surely enough , the capture had been thorough , for not a sign of further life could the victors detect . carter , anxious to preserve a means of access to the rest of dreamland , urged them not to sink the anchored galley ; and this request was freely granted out of gratitude for his act in reporting the plight of the captured trio . on the ship were found some very curious objects and decorations , some of which carter cast at once into the sea .\\n\\nghouls and night-gaunts now formed themselves in separate groups , the former questioning their rescued fellow anent past happenings . it appeared that the three had followed carter\\'s directions and proceeded from the enchanted wood to dylath-leen by way of nir and the skin , stealing human clothes at a lonely farmhouse and loping as closely as possible in the fashion of a man\\'s walk . in dylath-leen\\'s taverns their grotesque ways and faces had aroused much comment ; but they had persisted in asking the way to sarkomand until at last an old traveller was able to tell them . then they knew that only a ship for lelag-leng would serve their purpose , and prepared to wait patiently for such a vessel .\\n\\nbut evil spies had doubtless reported much ; for shortly a black galley put into port , and the wide-mouthed ruby merchants invited the ghouls to drink with them in a tavern . wine was produced from one of those sinister bottles grotesquely carven from a single ruby , and after that the ghouls found themselves prisoners on the black galley as carter had found himself . this time , however , the unseen rowers steered not for the moon but for antique sarkomand ; bent evidently on taking their captives before the high-priest not to be described . they had touched at the jagged rock in the northern sea which inquanok\\'s mariners shun , and the ghouls had there seen for the first time the red masters of the ship ; being sickened despite their own callousness by such extremes of malign shapelessness and fearsome odour . there , too , were witnessed the nameless pastimes of the toadlike resident garrison-such pastimes as give rise to the night-howlings which men fear . after that had come the landing at ruined sarkomand and the beginning of the tortures , whose continuance the present rescue had prevented .\\n\\nfuture plans were next discussed , the three rescued ghouls suggesting a raid on the jagged rock and the extermination of the toadlike garrison there . to this , however , the night-gaunts objected ; since the prospect of flying over water did not please them . most of the ghouls favoured the design , but were at a loss how to follow it without the help of the winged night-gaunts . thereupon carter , seeing that they could not navigate the anchored galley , offered to teach them the use of the great banks of oars ; to which proposal they eagerly assented . grey day had now come , and under that leaden northern sky a picked detachment of ghouls filed into the noisome ship and took their seats on the rowers\\' benches . carter found them fairly apt at learning , and before night had risked several experimental trips around the harbour . not till three days later , however , did he deem it safe to attempt the voyage of conquest . then , the rowers trained and the night-gaunts safely stowed in the forecastle , the party set sail at last ; pickman and the other chiefs gathering on deck and discussing models of approach and procedure .\\n\\non the very first night the howlings from the rock were heard . such was their timbre that all the galley\\'s crew shook visibly ; but most of all trembled the three rescued ghouls who knew precisely what those howlings meant . it was not thought best to attempt an attack by night , so the ship lay to under the phosphorescent clouds to wait for the dawn of a greyish day . when the light was ample and the howlings still the rowers resumed their strokes , and the galley drew closer and closer to that jagged rock whose granite pinnacles clawed fantastically at the dull sky . the sides of the rock were very steep ; but on ledges here and there could be seen the bulging walls of queer windowless dwellings , and the low railings guarding travelled highroads . no ship of men had ever come so near the place , or at least , had never come so near and departed again ; but carter and the ghouls were void of fear and kept inflexibly on , rounding the eastern face of the rock and seeking the wharves which the rescued trio described as being on the southern side within a harbour formed of steep headlands .\\n\\nthe headlands were prolongations of the island proper , and came so closely together that only one ship at a time might pass between them . there seemed to be no watchers on the outside , so the galley was steered boldly through the flume-like strait and into the stagnant putrid harbour beyond . here , however , all was bustle and activity ; with several ships lying at anchor along a forbidding stone quay , and scores of almost-human slaves and moonbeasts by the waterfront handling crates and boxes or driving nameless and fabulous horrors hitched to lumbering lorries . there was a small stone town hewn out of the vertical cliff above the wharves , with the start of a winding road that spiralled out of sight toward higher ledges of the rock . of what lay inside that prodigious peak of granite none might say , but the things one saw on the outside were far from encouraging .\\n\\nat sight of the incoming galley the crowds on the wharves displayed much eagerness ; those with eyes staring intently , and those without eyes wriggling their pink tentacles expectantly . they did not , of course , realize that the black ship had changed hands ; for ghouls look much like the horned and hooved almost-humans , and the night-gaunts were all out of sight below . by this time the leaders had fully formed a plan ; which was to loose the night-gaunts as soon as the wharf was touched , and then to sail directly away , leaving matters wholly to the instincts of those almost-mindless creatures . marooned on the rock , the horned flyers would first of all seize whatever living things they found there , and afterward , quite helpless to think except in terms of the homing instinct , would forget their fears of water and fly swiftly back to the abyss ; bearing their noisome prey to appropriate destinations in the dark , from which not much would emerge alive .\\n\\nthe ghoul that was pickman now went below and gave the night-gaunts their simple instructions , while the ship drew very near to the ominous and malodorous wharves . presently a fresh stir rose along the waterfront , and carter saw that the motions of the galley had begun to excite suspicion . evidently the steersman was not making for the right dock , and probably the watchers had noticed the difference between the hideous ghouls and the almost-human slaves whose places they were taking . some silent alarm must have been given , for almost at once a horde of the mephitic moonbeasts began to pour from the little black doorways of the windowless houses and down the winding road at the right . a rain of curious javelins struck the galley as the prow hit the wharf felling two ghouls and slightly wounding another ; but at this point all the hatches were thrown open to emit a black cloud of whirring night-gaunts which swarmed over the town like a flock of horned and cyclopean bats .\\n\\nthe jellyish moonbeasts had procured a great pole and were trying to push off the invading ship , but when the night-gaunts struck them they thought of such things no more . it was a very terrible spectacle to see those faceless and rubbery ticklers at their pastime , and tremendously impressive to watch the dense cloud of them spreading through the town and up the winding roadway to the reaches above . sometimes a group of the black flutterers would drop a toadlike prisoner from aloft by mistake , and the manner in which the victim would burst was highly offensive to the sight and smell . when the last of the night-gaunts had left the galley the ghoulish leaders glibbered an order of withdrawal , and the rowers pulled quietly out of the harbour between the grey headlands while still the town was a chaos of battle and conquest .\\n\\nthe pickman ghoul allowed several hours for the night-gaunts to make up their rudimentary minds and overcome their fear of flying over the sea , and kept the galley standing about a mile off the jagged rock while he waited , and dressed the wounds of the injured men . night fell , and the grey twilight gave place to the sickly phosphorescence of low clouds , and all the while the leaders watched the high peaks of that accursed rock for signs of the night-gaunts\\' flight . toward morning a black speck was seen hovering timidly over the top-most pinnacle , and shortly afterward the speck had become a swarm . just before daybreak the swarm seemed to scatter , and within a quarter of an hour it had vanished wholly in the distance toward the northeast . once or twice something seemed to fall from the thing swarm into the sea ; but carter did not worry , since he knew from observation that the toadlike moonbeasts cannot swim . at length , when the ghouls were satisfied that all the night-gaunts had left for sarkomand and the great abyss with their doomed burdens , the galley put back into the harbour betwixt the grey headlands ; and all the hideous company landed and roamed curiously over the denuded rock with its towers and eyries and fortresses chiselled from the solid stone .\\n\\nfrightful were the secrets uncovered in those evil and windowless crypts ; for the remnants of unfinished pastimes were many , and in various stages of departure from their primal state . carter put out of the way certain things which were after a fashion alive , and fled precipitately from a few other things about which he could not be very positive . the stench-filled houses were furnished mostly with grotesque stools and benches carven from moon-trees , and were painted inside with nameless and frantic designs . countless weapons , implements , and ornaments lay about , including some large idols of solid ruby depicting singular beings not found on the earth . these latter did not , despite their material , invite either appropriation or long inspection ; and carter took the trouble to hammer five of them into very small pieces . the scattered spears and javelins he collected , and with pickman\\'s approval distributed among the ghouls . such devices were new to the doglike lopers , but their relative simplicity made them easy to master after a few concise hints .\\n\\nthe upper parts of the rock held more temples than private homes , and in numerous hewn chambers were found terrible carven altars and doubtfully stained fonts and shrines for the worship of things more monstrous than the wild gods atop kadath . from the rear of one great temple stretched a low black passage which carter followed far into the rock with a torch till he came to a lightless domed hall of vast proportions , whose vaultings were covered with demoniac carvings and in whose centre yawned a foul and bottomless well like that in the hideous monastery of leng where broods alone the high-priest not to be described . on the distant shadowy side , beyond the noisome well , he thought he discerned a small door of strangely wrought bronze ; but for some reason he felt an unaccountable dread of opening it or even approaching it , and hastened back through the cavern to his unlovely allies as they shambled about with an ease and abandon he could scarcely feel . the ghouls had observed the unfinished pastimes of the moonbeasts , and had profited in their fashion . they had also found a hogshead of potent moon-wine , and were rolling it down to the wharves for removal and later use in diplomatic dealings , though the rescued trio , remembering its effect on them in dylath-leen , had warned their company to taste none of it . of rubies from lunar mines there was a great store , both rough and polished , in one of the vaults near the water ; but when the ghouls found they were not good to eat they lost all interest in them . carter did not try to carry any away , since he knew too much about those which had mined them .\\n\\nsuddenly there came an excited meeping from the sentries on the wharves , and all the loathsome foragers turned from their tasks to stare seaward and cluster round the waterfront . betwixt the grey headlands a fresh black galley was rapidly advancing , and it would be but a moment before the almost-humans on deck would perceive the invasion of the town and give the alarm to the monstrous things below . fortunately the ghouls still bore the spears and javelins which carter had distributed amongst them ; and at his command , sustained by the being that was pickman , they now formed a line of battle and prepared to prevent the landing of the ship . presently a burst of excitement on the galley told of the crew\\'s discovery of the changed state of things , and the instant stoppage of the vessel proved that the superior numbers of the ghouls had been noted and taken into account . after a moment of hesitation the new comers silently turned and passed out between the headlands again , but not for an instant did the ghouls imagine that the conflict was averted . either the dark ship would seek reinforcements or the crew would try to land elsewhere on the island ; hence a party of scouts was at once sent up toward the pinnacle to see what the enemy\\'s course would be .\\n\\nin a very few minutes the ghoul returned breathless to say that the moonbeasts and almost-humans were landing on the outside of the more easterly of the rugged grey headlands , and ascending by hidden paths and ledges which a goat could scarcely tread in safety . almost immediately afterward the galley was sighted again through the flume-like strait , but only for a second . then a few moments later , a second messenger panted down from aloft to say that another party was landing on the other headland ; both being much more numerous than the size of the galley would seem to allow for . the ship itself , moving slowly with only one sparsely manned tier of oars , soon hove in sight betwixt the cliffs , and lay to in the foetid harbour as if to watch the coming fray and stand by for any possible use .\\n\\nby this time carter and pickman had divided the ghouls into three parties , one to meet each of the two invading columns and one to remain in the town . the first two at once scrambled up the rocks in their respective directions , while the third was subdivided into a land party and a sea party . the sea party , commanded by carter , boarded the anchored galley and rowed out to meet the under-manned galley of the newcomers ; whereat the latter retreated through the strait to the open sea . carter did not at once pursue it , for he knew he might be needed more acutely near the town .\\n\\nmeanwhile the frightful detachments of the moonbeasts and almost-humans had lumbered up to the top of the headlands and were shockingly silhouetted on either side against the grey twilight sky . the thin hellish flutes of the invaders had now begun to whine , and the general effect of those hybrid , half-amorphous processions was as nauseating as the actual odour given off by the toadlike lunar blasphemies . then the two parties of the ghouls swarmed into sight and joined the silhouetted panorama . javelins began to fly from both sides , and the swelling meeps of the ghouls and the bestial howls of the almost--humans gradually joined the hellish whine of the flutes to form a frantick and indescribable chaos of daemon cacophony . now and then bodies fell from the narrow ridges of the headlands into the sea outside or the harbour inside , in the latter case being sucked quickly under by certain submarine lurkers whose presence was indicated only by prodigious bubbles .\\n\\nfor half an hour this dual battle raged in the sky , till upon the west cliff the invaders were completely annihilated . on the east cliff , however , where the leader of the moonbeast party appeared to be present , the ghouls had not fared so well ; and were slowly retreating to the slopes of the pinnacle proper . pickman had quickly ordered reinforcements for this front from the party in the town , and these had helped greatly in the earlier stages of the combat . then , when the western battle was over , the victorious survivors hastened across to the aid of their hard-pressed fellows ; turning the tide and forcing the invaders back again along the narrow ridge of the headland . the almost-humans were by this time all slain , but the last of the toadlike horrors fought desperately with the great spears clutched in their powerful and disgusting paws . the time for javelins was now nearly past , and the fight became a hand-to-hand contest of what few spearmen could meet upon that narrow ridge .\\n\\nas fury and recklessness increased , the number falling into the sea became very great . those striking the harbour met nameless extinction from the unseen bubblers , but of those striking the open sea some were able to swim to the foot of the cliffs and land on tidal rocks , while the hovering galley of the enemy rescued several moonbeasts . the cliffs were unscalable except where the monsters had debarked , so that none of the ghouls on the rocks could rejoin their battle-line . some were killed by javelins from the hostile galley or from the moonbeasts above , but a few survived to be rescued . when the security of the land parties seemed assured , carter\\'s galley sallied forth between the headlands and drove the hostile ship far out to sea ; pausing to rescue such ghouls as were on the rocks or still swimming in the ocean . several moonbeasts washed on rocks or reefs were speedily put out of the way .\\n\\nfinally , the moonbeast galley being safely in the distance and the invading land army concentrated in one place , carter landed a considerable force on the eastern headland in the enemy\\'s rear ; after which the fight was short-lived indeed . attacked from both sides , the noisome flounderers were rapidly cut to pieces or pushed into the sea , till by evening the ghoulish chiefs agreed that the island was again clear of them . the hostile galley , meanwhile , had disappeared ; and it was decided that the evil jagged rock had better be evacuated before any overwhelming horde of lunar horrors might be assembled and brought against the victors .\\n\\nso by night pickman and carter assembled all the ghouls and counted them with care , finding that over a fourth had been lost in the day\\'s battles . the wounded were placed on bunks in the galley , for pickman always discouraged the old ghoulish custom of killing and eating one\\'s own wounded , and the able-bodied troops were assigned to the oars or to such other places as they might most usefully fill . under the low phosphorescent clouds of night the galley sailed , and carter was not sorry to be departing from the island of unwholesome secrets , whose lightless domed hall with its bottomless well and repellent bronze door lingered restlessly in his fancy . dawn found the ship in sight of sarkomand\\'s ruined quays of basalt , where a few night-gaunt sentries still waited , squatting like black horned gargoyles on the broken columns and crumbling sphinxes of that fearful city which lived and died before the years of man .\\n\\nthe ghouls made camp amongst the fallen stones of sarkomand , despatching a messenger for enough night-gaunts to serve them as steeds . pickman and the other chiefs were effusive in their gratitude for the aid carter had lent them . carter now began to feel that his plans were indeed maturing well , and that he would be able to command the help of these fearsome allies not only in quitting this part of dreamland , but in pursuing his ultimate quest for the gods atop unknown kadath , and the marvellous sunset city they so strangely withheld from his slumbers . accordingly he spoke of these things to the ghoulish leaders ; telling what he knew of the cold waste wherein kadath stands and of the monstrous shantaks and the mountains carven into double-headed images which guard it . he spoke of the fear of shantaks for night-gaunts , and of how the vast hippocephalic birds fly screaming from the black burrows high up on the gaunt grey peaks that divide inquanok from hateful leng . he spoke , too , of the things he had learned concerning night-gaunts from the frescoes in the windowless monastery of the high-priest not to be described ; how even the great ones fear them , and how their ruler is not the crawling chaos nyarlathotep at all , but hoary and immemorial nodens , lord of the great abyss .\\n\\nall these things carter glibbered to the assembled ghouls , and presently outlined that request which he had in mind and which he did not think extravagant considering the services he had so lately rendered the rubbery doglike lopers . he wished very much , he said , for the services of enough night-gaunts to bear him safely through the aft past the realm of shantaks and carven mountains , and up into the old waste beyond the returning tracks of any other mortal . he desired to fly to the onyx castle atop unknown kadath in the cold waste to plead with the great ones for the sunset city they denied him , and felt sure that the night-gaunts could take him thither without trouble ; high above the perils of the plain , and over the hideous double heads of those carven sentinel mountains that squat eternally in the grey dusk . for the horned and faceless creatures there could be no danger from aught of earth since the great ones themselves dread them . and even were unexpected things to come from the other gods , who are prone to oversee the affairs of earth\\'s milder gods , the night-gaunts need not fear ; for the outer hells are indifferent matters to such silent and slippery flyers as own not nyarlathotep for their master , but bow only to potent and archaic nodens .\\n\\na flock of ten or fifteen night-gaunts , carter glibbered , would surely be enough to keep any combination of shantaks at a distance , though perhaps it might be well to have some ghouls in the party to manage the creatures , their ways being better known to their ghoulish allies than to men . the party could land him at some convenient point within whatever walls that fabulous onyx citadel might have , waiting in the shadows for his return or his signal whilst he ventured inside the castle to give prayer to the gods of earth . if any ghouls chose to escort him into the throne-room of the great ones , he would be thankful , for their presence would add weight and importance to his plea . he would not , however , insist upon this but merely wished transportation to and from the castle atop unknown kadath ; the final journey being either to the marvellous sunset city itself , in case of gods proved favourable , or back to the earthward gate of deeper slumber in the enchanted wood in case his prayers were fruitless .\\n\\nwhilst carter was speaking all the ghouls listened with great attention , and as the moments advanced the sky became black with clouds of those night-gaunts for which messengers had been sent . the winged steeds settled in a semicircle around the ghoulish army , waiting respectfully as the doglike chieftains considered the wish of the earthly traveller . the ghoul that was pickman glibbered gravely with his fellows and in the end carter was offered far more than he had at most expected . as he had aided the ghouls in their conquest of the moonbeasts , so would they aid him in his daring voyage to realms whence none had ever returned ; lending him not merely a few of their allied night-gaunts , but their entire army as then encamped , veteran fighting ghouls and newly assembled night-gaunts alike , save only a small garrison for the captured black galley and such spoils as had come from the jagged rock in the sea . they would set out through the aft whenever he might wish , and once arrived on kadath a suitable train of ghouls would attend him in state as he placed his petition before earth\\'s gods in their onyx castle .\\n\\nmoved by a gratitude and satisfaction beyond words , carter made plans with the ghoulish leaders for his audacious voyage . the army would fly high , they decided , over hideous leng with its nameless monastery and wicked stone villages ; stopping only at the vast grey peaks to confer with the shantak-frightening night-gaunts whose burrows honeycombed their summits . they would then , according to what advice they might receive from those denizens , choose their final course ; approaching unknown kadath either through the desert of carven mountains north of inquanok , or through the more northerly reaches of repulsive leng itself . doglike and soulless as they are , the ghouls and night-gaunts had no dread of what those untrodden deserts might reveal ; nor did they feel any deterring awe at the thought of kadath towering lone with its onyx castle of mystery .\\n\\nabout midday the ghouls and night-gaunts prepared for flight , each ghoul selecting a suitable pair of horned steeds to bear him . carter was placed well up toward the head of the column beside pickman , and in front of the whole a double line of riderless night-gaunts was provided as a vanguard . at a brisk meep from pickman the whole shocking army rose in a nightmare cloud above the broken columns and crumbling sphinxes of primordial sarkomand ; higher and higher , till even the great basalt cliff behind the town was cleared , and the cold , sterile table-land of leng\\'s outskirts laid open to sight . still higher flew the black host , till even this table-land grew small beneath them ; and as they worked northward over the wind-swept plateau of horror carter saw once again with a shudder the circle of crude monoliths and the squat windowless building which he knew held that frightful silken-masked blasphemy from whose clutches he had so narrowly escaped . this time no descent was made as the army swept batlike over the sterile landscape , passing the feeble fires of the unwholesome stone villages at a great altitude , and pausing not at all to mark the morbid twistings of the hooved , horned almost-humans that dance and pipe eternally therein . once they saw a shantak-bird flying low over the plain , but when it saw them it screamed noxiously and flapped off to the north in grotesque panic .\\n\\nat dusk they reached the jagged grey peaks that form the barrier of inquanok , and hovered about these strange caves near the summits which carter recalled as so frightful to the shantaks . at the insistent meeping of the ghoulish leaders there issued forth from each lofty burrow a stream of horned black flyers with which the ghouls and night-gaunts of the party conferred at length by means of ugly gestures . it soon became clear that the best course would be that over the cold waste north of inquanok , for leng\\'s northward reaches are full of unseen pitfalls that even the night-gaunts dislike ; abysmal influences centering in certain white hemispherical buildings on curious knolls , which common folklore associates unpleasantly with the other gods and their crawling chaos nyarlathotep .\\n\\nof kadath the flutterers of the peaks knew almost nothing , save that there must be some mighty marvel toward the north , over which the shantaks and the carven mountains stand guard . they hinted at rumoured abnormalities of proportion in those trackless leagues beyond , and recalled vague whispers of a realm where night broods eternally ; but of definite data they had nothing to give . so carter and his party thanked them kindly ; and , crossing the topmost granite pinnacles to the skies of inquanok , dropped below the level of the phosphorescent night clouds and beheld in the distance those terrible squatting gargoyles that were mountains till some titan hand carved fright into their virgin rock .\\n\\nthere they squatted in a hellish half-circle , their legs on the desert sand and their mitres piercing the luminous clouds ; sinister , wolflike , and double-headed , with faces of fury and right hands raised , dully and malignly watching the rim of man\\'s world and guarding with horror the reaches of a cold northern world that is not man\\'s . from their hideous laps rose evil shantaks of elephantine bulk , but these all fled with insane titters as the vanguard of night-gaunts was sighted in the misty sky . northward above those gargoyle mountains the army flew , and over leagues of dim desert where never a landmark rose . less and less luminous grew the clouds , till at length carter could see only blackness around him ; but never did the winged steeds falter , bred as they were in earth\\'s blackest crypts , and seeing not with any eyes , but with the whole dank surface of their slippery forms . on and on they flew , past winds of dubious scent and sounds of dubious import ; ever in thickest darkness , and covering such prodigious spaces that carter wondered whether or not they could still be within earth\\'s dreamland .\\n\\nthen suddenly the clouds thinned and the stars shone spectrally above . all below was still black , but those pallid beacons in the sky seemed alive with a meaning and directiveness they had never possessed elsewhere . it was not that the figures of the constellations were different , but that the same familiar shapes now revealed a significance they had formerly failed to make plain . everything focussed toward the north ; every curve and asterism of the glittering sky became part of a vast design whose function was to hurry first the eye and then the whole observer onward to some secret and terrible goal of convergence beyond the frozen waste that stretched endlessly ahead . carter looked toward the east where the great ridge of barrier peaks had towered along all the length of inquanok and saw against the stars a jagged silhouette which told of its continued presence . it was more broken now , with yawning clefts and fantastically erratic pinnacles ; and carter studied closely the suggestive turnings and inclinations of that grotesque outline , which seemed to share with the stars some subtle northward urge .\\n\\nthey were flying past at a tremendous speed , so that the watcher had to strain hard to catch details ; when all at once he beheld just above the line of the topmost peaks a dark and moving object against the stars , whose course exactly paralleled that of his own bizarre party . the ghouls had likewise glimpsed it , for he heard their low glibbering all about him , and for a moment he fancied the object was a gigantic shantak , of a size vastly greater than that of the average specimen . soon , however , he saw that this theory would not hold ; for the shape of the thing above the mountains was not that of any hippocephalic bird . its outline against the stars , necessarily vague as it was , resembled rather some huge mitred head , or pair of heads infinitely magnified ; and its rapid bobbing flight through the sky seemed most peculiarly a wingless one . carter could not tell which side of the mountains it was on , but soon perceived that it had parts below the parts he had first seen , since it blotted out all the stars in places where the ridge was deeply cleft .\\n\\nthen came a wide gap in the range , where the hideous reaches of transmontane leng were joined to the cold waste on this side by a low pass trough which the stars shone wanly . carter watched this gap with intense care , knowing that he might see outlined against the sky beyond it the lower parts of the vast thing that flew undulantly above the pinnacles . the object had now floated ahead a trifle , and every eye of the party was fixed on the rift where it would presently appear in full-length silhouette . gradually the huge thing above the peaks neared the gap , slightly slackening its speed as if conscious of having outdistanced the ghoulish army . for another minute suspense was keen , and then the brief instant of full silhouette and revelation came ; bringing to the lips of the ghouls an awed and half-choked meep of cosmic fear , and to the soul of the traveller a chill that never wholly left it . for the mammoth bobbing shape that overtopped the ridge was only a head--a mitred double head--and below it in terrible vastness loped the frightful swollen body that bore it ; the mountain--high monstrosity that walked in stealth and silence ; the hyaena-like distortion of a giant anthropoid shape that trotted blackly against the sky , its repulsive pair of cone-capped heads reaching half way to the zenith .\\n\\ncarter did not lose consciousness or even scream aloud , for he was an old dreamer ; but he looked behind him in horror and shuddered when he saw that there were other monstrous heads silhouetted above the level of the peaks , bobbing along stealthily after the first one . and straight in the rear were three of the mighty mountain shapes seen full against the southern stars , tiptoeing wolflike and lumberingly , their tall mitres nodding thousands of feet in the aft . the carven mountains , then , had not stayed squatting in that rigid semicircle north of inquanok , with right hands uplifted . they had duties to perform , and were not remiss . but it was horrible that they never spoke , and never even made a sound in walking .\\n\\nmeanwhile the ghoul that was pickman had glibbered an order to the night-gaunts , and the whole army soared higher into the air . up toward the stars the grotesque column shot , till nothing stood out any longer against the sky ; neither the grey granite ridge that was still nor the carven mitred mountains that walked . all was blackness beneath as the fluttering legion surged northward amidst rushing winds and invisible laughter in the aether , and never a shantak or less mentionable entity rose from the haunted wastes to pursue them . the farther they went , the faster they flew , till soon their dizzying speed seemed to pass that of a rifle ball and approach that of a planet in its orbit . carter wondered how with such speed the earth could still stretch beneath them , but knew that in the land of dream dimensions have strange properties . that they were in a realm of eternal night he felt certain , and he fancied that the constellations overhead had subtly emphasized their northward focus ; gathering themselves up as it were to cast the flying army into the void of the boreal pole , as the folds of a bag are gathered up to cast out the last bits of substance therein .\\n\\nthen he noticed with terror that the wings of the night-gaunts were not flapping any more . the horned and faceless steeds had folded their membranous appendages , and were resting quite passive in the chaos of wind that whirled and chuckled as it bore them on . a force not of earth had seized on the army , and ghouls and night-gaunts alike were powerless before a current which pulled madly and relentlessly into the north whence no mortal had ever returned . at length a lone pallid light was seen on the skyline ahead , thereafter rising steadily as they approached , and having beneath it a black mass that blotted out the stars . carter saw that it must be some beacon on a mountain , for only a mountain could rise so vast as seen from so prodigious a height in the air .\\n\\nhigher and higher rose the light and the blackness beneath it , till all the northern sky was obscured by the rugged conical mass . lofty as the army was , that pale and sinister beacon rose above it , towering monstrous over all peaks and concernments of earth , and tasting the atomless aether where the cryptical moon and the mad planets reel . no mountain known of man was that which loomed before them . the high clouds far below were but a fringe for its foothills . the groping dizziness of topmost air was but a girdle for its loins . scornful and spectral climbed that bridge betwixt earth and heaven , black in eternal night , and crowned with a pshent of unknown stars whose awful and significant outline grew every moment clearer . ghouls meeped in wonder as they saw it , and carter shivered in fear lest all the hurtling army be dashed to pieces on the unyielding onyx of that cyclopean cliff .\\n\\nhigher and higher rose the light , till it mingled with the loftiest orbs of the zenith and winked down at the flyers with lurid mockery . all the north beneath it was blackness now ; dread , stony blackness from infinite depths to infinite heights , with only that pale winking beacon perched unreachably at the top of all vision . carter studied the light more closely , and saw at last what lines its inky background made against the stars . there were towers on that titan mountaintop ; horrible domed towers in noxious and incalculable tiers and clusters beyond any dreamable workmanship of man ; battlements and terraces of wonder and menace , all limned tiny and black and distant against the starry pshent that glowed malevolently at the uppermost rim of sight . capping that most measureless of mountains was a castle beyond all mortal thought , and in it glowed the daemon-light . then randolph carter knew that his quest was done , and that he saw above him the goal of all forbidden steps and audacious visions ; the fabulous , the incredible home of the great ones atop unknown kadath .\\n\\neven as he realised this thing , carter noticed a change in the course of the helplessly wind-sucked party . they were rising abruptly now , and it was plain that the focus of their flight was the onyx castle where the pale light shone . so close was the great black mountain that its sides sped by them dizzily as they shot upward , and in the darkness they could discern nothing upon it . vaster and vaster loomed the tenebrous towers of the nighted castle above , and carter could see that it was well-nigh blasphemous in its immensity . well might its stones have been quarried by nameless workmen in that horrible gulf rent out of the rock in the hill pass north of inquanok , for such was its size that a man on its threshold stood even as air out on the steps of earth\\'s loftiest fortress . the pshent of unknown stars above the myriad domed turrets glowed with a sallow , sickly flare , so that a kind of twilight hung about the murky walls of slippery onyx . the pallid beacon was now seen to be a single shining window high up in one of the loftiest towers , and as the helpless army neared the top of the mountain carter thought he detected unpleasant shadows flitting across the feebly luminous expanse . it was a strangely arched window , of a design wholly alien to earth .\\n\\nthe solid rock now gave place to the giant foundations of the monstrous castle , and it seemed that the speed of the party was somewhat abated . vast walls shot up , and there was a glimpse of a great gate through which the voyagers were swept . all was night in the titan courtyard , and then came the deeper blackness of inmost things as a huge arched portal engulfed the column . vortices of cold wind surged dankly through sightless labyrinths of onyx , and carter could never tell what cyclopean stairs and corridors lay silent along the route of his endless aerial twisting . always upward led the terrible plunge in darkness , and never a sound , touch or glimpse broke the dense pall of mystery . large as the army of ghouls and night-gaunts was , it was lost in the prodigious voids of that more than earthly castle . and when at last there suddenly dawned around him the lurid light of that single tower room whose lofty window had served as a beacon , it took carter long to discern the far walls and high , distant ceiling , and to realize that he was indeed not again in the boundless air outside .\\n\\nrandolph carter had hoped to come into the throne-room of the great ones with poise and dignity , flanked and followed by impressive lines of ghouls in ceremonial order , and offering his prayer as a free and potent master among dreamers . he had known that the great ones themselves are not beyond a mortal\\'s power to cope with , and had trusted to luck that the other gods and their crawling chaos nyarlathotep would not happen to come to their aid at the crucial moment , as they had so often done before when men sought out earth\\'s gods in their home or on their mountains . and with his hideous escort he had half hoped to defy even the other gods if need were , knowing as he did that ghouls have no masters , and that night-gaunts own not nyarlathotep but only archaic nodens for their lord . but now he saw that supernal kadath in its cold waste is indeed girt with dark wonders and nameless sentinels , and that the other gods are of a surety vigilant in guarding the mild , feeble gods of earth . void as they are of lordship over ghouls and night-gaunts , the mindless , shapeless blasphemies of outer space can yet control them when they must ; so that it was not in state as a free and potent master of dreamers that randolph carter came into the great ones\\' throne-room with his ghouls . swept and herded by nightmare tempests from the stars , and dogged by unseen horrors of the northern waste , all that army floated captive and helpless in the lurid light , dropping numbly to the onyx floor when by some voiceless order the winds of fright dissolved .\\n\\nbefore no golden dais had randolph carter come , nor was there any august circle of crowned and haloed beings with narrow eyes , long-lobed ears , thin nose , and pointed chin whose kinship to the carven face on ngranek might stamp them as those to whom a dreamer might pray . save for the one tower room the onyx castle atop kadath was dark , and the masters were not there . carter had come to unknown kadath in the cold waste , but he had not found the gods . yet still the lurid light glowed in that one tower room whose size was so little less than that of all outdoors , and whose distant walls and roof were so nearly lost to sight in thin , curling mists . earth\\'s gods were not there , it was true , but of subtler and less visible presences there could be no lack . where the mild gods are absent , the other gods are not unrepresented ; and certainly , the onyx castle of castles was far from tenantless . in what outrageous form or forms terror would next reveal itself carter could by no means imagine . he felt that his visit had been expected , and wondered how close a watch had all along been kept upon him by the crawling chaos nyarlathotep . it is nyarlathotep , horror of infinite shapes and dread soul and messenger of the other gods , that the fungous moonbeasts serve ; and carter thought of the black galley that had vanished when the tide of battle turned against the toadlike abnormalities on the jagged rock in the sea .\\n\\nreflecting upon these things , he was staggering to his feet in the midst of his nightmare company when there rang without warning through that pale-litten and limitless chamber the hideous blast of a daemon trumpet . three times pealed that frightful brazen scream , and when the echoes of the third blast had died chucklingly away randolph carter saw that he was alone . whither , why and how the ghouls and night--gaunts had been snatched from sight was not for him to divine . he knew only that he was suddenly alone , and that whatever unseen powers lurked mockingly around him were no powers of earth\\'s friendly dreamland . presently from the chamber\\'s uttermost reaches a new sound came . this , too , was a rhythmic trumpeting ; but of a kind far removed from the three raucous blasts which had dissolved his goodly cohorts . in this low fanfare echoed all the wonder and melody of ethereal dream ; exotic vistas of unimagined loveliness floating from each strange chord and subtly alien cadence . odours of incense came to match the golden notes ; and overhead a great light dawned , its colours changing in cycles unknown to earth\\'s spectrum , and following the song of the trumpets in weird symphonic harmonies . torches flared in the distance , and the beat of drums throbbed nearer amidst waves of tense expectancy .\\n\\nout of the thinning mists and the cloud of strange incenses filed twin columns of giant black slaves with loin-cloths of iridescent silk . upon their heads were strapped vast helmet-like torches of glittering metal , from which the fragrance of obscure balsams spread in fumous spirals . in their right hands were crystal wands whose tips were carven into leering chimaeras , while their left hands grasped long thin silver trumpets which they blew in turn . armlets and anklets of gold they had , and between each pair of anklets stretched a golden chain that held its wearer to a sober gait . that they were true black men of earth\\'s dreamland was at once apparent , but it seemed less likely that their rites and costumes were wholly things of our earth . ten feet from carter the columns stopped , and as they did so each trumpet flew abruptly to its bearer\\'s thick lips . wild and ecstatic was the blast that followed , and wilder still the cry that chorused just after from dark throats somehow made shrill by strange artifice .\\n\\nthen down the wide lane betwixt the two columns a lone figure strode ; a tall , slim figure with the young face of an antique pharaoh , gay with prismatic robes and crowned with a golden pshent that glowed with inherent light . close up to carter strode that regal figure ; whose proud carriage and smart features had in them the fascination of a dark god or fallen archangel , and around whose eyes there lurked the languid sparkle of capricious humour . it spoke , and in its mellow tones there rippled the wild music of lethean streams .\\n\\n\"randolph carter ,\" said the voice , \"you have come to see the great ones whom it is unlawful for men to see . watchers have spoken of this thing , and the other gods have grunted as they rolled and tumbled mindlessly to the sound of thin flutes in the black ultimate void where broods the daemon-sultan whose name no lips dare speak aloud .\\n\\n\"when barzai the wise climbed hatheg-kia to see the greater ones dance and howl above the clouds in the moonlight he never returned . the other gods were there , and they did what was expected . zenig of aphorat sought to reach unknown kadath in the cold waste , and his skull is now set in a ring on the little finger of one whom i need not name .\\n\\n\"but you , randolph carter , have braved all things of earth\\'s dreamland , and burn still with the flame of quest . you came not as one curious , but as one seeking his due , nor have you failed ever in reverence toward the mild gods of earth . yet have these gods kept you from the marvellous sunset city of your dreams , and wholly through their own small covetousness ; for verily , they craved the weird loveliness of that which your fancy had fashioned , and vowed that henceforward no other spot should be their abode .\\n\\n\"they are gone from their castle on unknown kadath to dwell in your marvellous city . all through its palaces of veined marble they revel by day , and when the sun sets they go out in the perfumed gardens and watch the golden glory on temples and colonnades , arched bridges and silver-basined fountains , and wide streets with blossom-laden urns and ivory statues in gleaming rows . and when night comes they climb tall terraces in the dew , and sit on carved benches of porphyry scanning the stars , or lean over pale balustrades to gaze at the town\\'s steep northward slopes , where one by one the little windows in old peaked gables shine softly out with the calm yellow light of homely candles .\\n\\n\"the gods love your marvellous city , and walk no more in the ways of the gods . they have forgotten the high places of earth , and the mountains that knew their youth . the earth has no longer any gods that are gods , and only the other ones from outer space hold sway on unremembered kadath . far away in a valley of your own childhood , randolph carter , play the heedless great ones . you have dreamed too well , o wise arch-dreamer , for you have drawn dream\\'s gods away from the world of all men\\'s visions to that which is wholly yours ; having builded out of your boyhood\\'s small fancies a city more lovely than all the phantoms that have gone before .\\n\\n\"it is not well that earth\\'s gods leave their thrones for the spider to spin on , and their realm for the others to sway in the dark manner of others . fain would the powers from outside bring chaos and horror to you , randolph carter , who are the cause of their upsetting , but that they know it is by you alone that the gods may be sent back to their world . in that half-waking dreamland which is yours , no power of uttermost night may pursue ; and only you can send the selfish great ones gently out of your marvellous sunset city , back through the northern twilight to their wonted place atop unknown kadath in the cold waste .\\n\\n\"so . randolph carter , in the name of the other gods i spare you and charge you to seek that sunset city which is yours , and to send thence the drowsy truant gods for whom the dream world waits . not hard to find is that roseal fever of the gods , that fanfare of supernal trumpets and clash of immortal cymbals , that mystery whose place and meaning have haunted you through the halls of waking and the gulfs of dreaming , and tormented you with hints of vanished memory and the pain of lost things awesome and momentous . not hard to find is that symbol and relic of your days of wonder , for truly , it is but the stable and eternal gem wherein all that wonder sparkles crystallised to light your evening path . behold ! it is not over unknown seas but back over well-known years that your quest must go ; back to the bright strange things of infancy and the quick sun-drenched glimpses of magic that old scenes brought to wide young eyes .\\n\\n\"for know you , that your gold and marble city of wonder is only the sum of what you have seen and loved in youth . it is the glory of boston\\'s hillside roofs and western windows aflame with sunset , of the flower-fragrant common and the great dome on the hill and the tangle of gables and chimneys in the violet valley where the many-bridged charles flows drowsily . these things you saw , randolph carter , when your nurse first wheeled you out in the springtime , and they will be the last things you will ever see with eyes of memory and of love . and there is antique salem with its brooding years , and spectral marblehead scaling its rocky precipices into past centuries ! and the glory of salem\\'s towers and spires seen afar from marblehead\\'s pastures across the harbour against the setting sun .\\n\\n\"there is providence quaint and lordly on its seven hills over the blue harbour , with terraces of green leading up to steeples and citadels of living antiquity , and newport climbing wraithlike from its dreaming breakwater . arkham is there , with its moss-grown gambrel roofs and the rocky rolling meadows behind it ; and antediluvian kingsport hoary with stacked chimneys and deserted quays and overhanging gables , and the marvel of high cliffs and the milky-misted ocean with tolling buoys beyond .\\n\\n\"cool vales in concord , cobbled lands in portsmouth , twilight bends of rustic new hampshire roads where giant elms half hide white farmhouse walls and creaking well-sweeps . gloucester\\'s salt wharves and truro\\'s windy willows . vistas of distant steepled towns and hills beyond hills along the north shore , hushed stony slopes and low ivied cottages in the lee of huge boulders in rhode island\\'s back country . scent of the sea and fragrance of the fields ; spell of the dark woods and joy of the orchards and gardens at dawn . these , randolph carter , are your city ; for they are yourself . new england bore you , and into your soul she poured a liquid loveliness which cannot die . this loveliness , moulded , crystallised , and polished by years of memory and dreaming , is your terraced wonder of elusive sunsets ; and to find that marble parapet with curious urns and carven rail , and descend at last these endless balustraded steps to the city of broad squares and prismatic fountains , you need only to turn back to the thoughts and visions of your wistful boyhood .\\n\\n\"look ! through that window shine the stars of eternal night . even now they are shining above the scenes you have known and cherished , drinking of their charm that they may shine more lovely over the gardens of dream . there is antares-he is winking at this moment over the roofs of tremont street , and you could see him from your window on beacon hill . out beyond those stars yawn the gulfs from whence my mindless masters have sent me . some day you too may traverse them , but if you are wise you will beware such folly ; for of those mortals who have been and returned , only one preserves a mind unshattered by the pounding , clawing horrors of the void . terrors and blasphemies gnaw at one another for space , and there is more evil in the lesser ones than in the greater ; even as you know from the deeds of those who sought to deliver you into my hands , whilst i myself harboured no wish to shatter you , and would indeed have helped you hither long ago had i not been elsewhere busy , and certain that you would yourself find the way . shun then , the outer hells , and stick to the calm , lovely things of your youth . seek out your marvellous city and drive thence the recreant great ones , sending them back gently to those scenes which are of their own youth , and which wait uneasy for their return .\\n\\n\"easier even then the way of dim memory is the way i will prepare for you . see ! there comes hither a monstrous shantak , led by a slave who for your peace of mind had best keep invisible . mount and be ready--there ! yogash the black will help you on the scaly horror . steer for that brightest star just south of the zenith--it is vega , and in two hours will be just above the terrace of your sunset city . steer for it only till you hear a far-off singing in the high aether . higher than that lurks madness , so rein your shantak when the first note lures . look then back to earth , and you will see shining the deathless altar--flame of ired-naa from the sacred roof of a temple . that temple is in your desiderate sunset city , so steer for it before you heed the singing and are lost .\\n\\n\"when you draw nigh the city steer for the same high parapet whence of old you scanned the outspread glory , prodding the shantak till he cry aloud . that cry the great ones will hear and know as they sit on their perfumed terraces , and there will come upon them such a homesickness that all of your city\\'s wonders will not console them for the absence of kadath\\'s grim castle and the pshent of eternal stars that crowns it .\\n\\n\"then must you land amongst them with the shantak , and let them see and touch that noisome and hippocephalic bird ; meanwhile discoursing to them of unknown kadath , which you will so lately have left , and telling them how its boundless halls are lovely and unlighted , where of old they used to leap and revel in supernal radiance . and the shantak will talk to them in the manner of shantaks , but it will have no powers of persuasion beyond the recalling of elder days .\\n\\n\"over and over must you speak to the wandering great ones of their home and youth , till at last they will weep and ask to be shewn the returning path they have forgotten . thereat can you loose the waiting shantak , sending him skyward with the homing cry of his kind ; hearing which the great ones will prance and jump with antique mirth , and forthwith stride after the loathly bird in the fashion of gods , through the deep gulfs of heaven to kadath\\'s familiar towers and domes .\\n\\n\"then will the marvellous sunset city be yours to cherish and inhabit for ever , and once more will earth\\'s gods rule the dreams of men from their accustomed seat . go now--the casement is open and the stars await outside . already your shantak wheezes and titters with impatience . steer for vega through the night , but turn when the singing sounds . forget not this warning , lest horrors unthinkable suck you into the gulf of shrieking and ululant madness . remember the other gods ; they are great and mindless and terrible , and lurk in the outer voids . they are good gods to shun .\\n\\n\"hei ! aa-shanta \\'nygh ! you are off ! send back earth\\'s gods to their haunts on unknown kadath , and pray to all space that you may never meet me in my thousand other forms . farewell , randolph carter , and beware ; for i am nyarlathotep , the crawling chaos .\"\\n\\nand randolph carter , gasping and dizzy on his hideous shantak , shot screamingly into space toward the cold blue glare of boreal vega ; looking but once behind him at the clustered and chaotic turrets of the onyx nightmare wherein still glowed the lone lurid light of that window above the air and the clouds of earth\\'s dreamland . great polypous horrors slid darkly past , and unseen bat wings beat multitudinous around him , but still he clung to the unwholesome mane of that loathly and hippocephalic scaled bird . the stars danced mockingly , almost shifting now and then to form pale signs of doom that one might wonder one had not seen and feared before ; and ever the winds of nether howled of vague blackness and loneliness beyond the cosmos .\\n\\nthen through the glittering vault ahead there fell a hush of portent , and all the winds and horrors slunk away as night things slink away before the dawn . trembling in waves that golden wisps of nebula made weirdly visible , there rose a timid hint of far-off melody , droning in faint chords that our own universe of stars knows not . and as that music grew , the shantak raised its ears and plunged ahead , and carter likewise bent to catch each lovely strain . it was a song , but not the song of any voice . night and the spheres sang it , and it was old when space and nyarlathotep and the other gods were born .\\n\\nfaster flew the shantak , and lower bent the rider , drunk with the marvel of strange gulfs , and whirling in the crystal coils of outer magic . then came too late the warning of the evil one , the sardonic caution of the daemon legate who had bidden the seeker beware the madness of that song . only to taunt had nyarlathotep marked out the way to safety and the marvellous sunset city ; only to mock had that black messenger revealed the secret of these truant gods whose steps he could so easily lead back at will . for madness and the void\\'s wild vengeance are nyarlathotep\\'s only gifts to the presumptuous ; and frantick though the rider strove to turn his disgusting steed , that leering , tittering shantak coursed on impetuous and relentless , flapping its great slippery wings in malignant joy and headed for those unhallowed pits whither no dreams reach ; that last amorphous blight of nether-most confusion where bubbles and blasphemes at infinity\\'s centre the mindless daemon-sultan azathoth , whose name no lips dare speak aloud .\\n\\nunswerving and obedient to the foul legate\\'s orders , that hellish bird plunged onward through shoals of shapeless lurkers and caperers in darkness , and vacuous herds of drifting entities that pawed and groped and groped and pawed ; the nameless larvae of the other gods , that are like them blind and without mind , and possessed of singular hungers and thirsts\\n\\nonward unswerving and relentless , and tittering hilariously to watch the chuckling and hysterics into which the risen song of night and the spheres had turned , that eldritch scaly monster bore its helpless rider ; hurtling and shooting , cleaving the uttermost rim and spanning the outermost abysses ; leaving behind the stars and the realms of matter , and darting meteor-like through stark formlessness toward those inconceivable , unlighted chambers beyond time wherein azathoth gnaws shapeless and ravenous amidst the muffled , maddening beat of vile drums and the thin , monotonous whine of accursed flutes .\\n\\nonward--onward--through the screaming , cackling , and blackly populous gulfs--and then from some dim blessed distance there came an image and a thought to randolph carter the doomed . too well had nyarlathotep planned his mocking and his tantalising , for he had brought up that which no gusts of icy terror could quite efface . home--new england--beacon hill--the waking world .\\n\\n\"for know you , that your gold and marble city of wonder is only the sum of what you have seen and loved in youth . . .the glory of boston\\'s hillside roofs and western windows aflame with sunset ; of the flower--fragrant common and the great dome on the hill and the tangle of gables and chimneys in the violet valley where the many-bridged charles flows drowsily . . .this loveliness , moulded , crystallised , and polished by years of memory and dreaming , is your terraced wonder of elusive sunsets ; and to find that marble parapet with curious urns and carven rail , and descend at last those endless balustraded steps to the city of broad squares and prismatic fountains , you need only to turn back to the thoughts and visions of your wistful boyhood .\"\\n\\nonward--onward--dizzily onward to ultimate doom through the blackness where sightless feelers pawed and slimy snouts jostled and nameless things tittered and tittered and tittered . but the image and the thought had come , and randolph carter knew clearly that he was dreaming and only dreaming , and that somewhere in the background the world of waking and the city of his infancy still lay . words came again--\"you need only turn back to the thoughts and visions of your wistful boyhood .\"turn--turn--blackness on every side , but randolph carter could turn .\\n\\nthick though the rushing nightmare that clutched his senses , randolph carter could turn and move . he could move , and if he chose he could leap off the evil shantak that bore him hurtlingly doomward at the orders of nyarlathotep . he could leap off and dare those depths of night that yawned interminably down , those depths of fear whose terrors yet could not exceed the nameless doom that lurked waiting at chaos\\' core . he could turn and move and leap--he could--he would--he would--he would .\\n\\noff that vast hippocephalic abomination leaped the doomed and desperate dreamer , and down through endless voids of sentient blackness he fell . aeons reeled , universes died and were born again , stars became nebulae and nebulae became stars , and still randolph carter fell through those endless voids of sentient blackness .\\n\\nthen in the slow creeping course of eternity the utmost cycle of the cosmos churned itself into another futile completion , and all things became again as they were unreckoned kalpas before . matter and light were born anew as space once had known them ; and comets , suns and worlds sprang flaming into life , though nothing survived to tell that they had been and gone , been and gone , always and always , back to no first beginning .\\n\\nand there was a firmament again , and a wind , and a glare of purple light in the eyes of the falling dreamer . there were gods and presences and wills ; beauty and evil , and the shrieking of noxious night robbed of its prey . for through the unknown ultimate cycle had lived a thought and a vision of a dreamer\\'s boyhood , and now there were remade a waking world and an old cherished city to body and to justify these things . out of the void s\\'ngac the violet gas had pointed the way , and archaic nodens was bellowing his guidance from unhinted deeps .\\n\\nstars swelled to dawns , and dawns burst into fountains of gold , carmine , and purple , and still the dreamer fell . cries rent the aether as ribbons of light beat back the fiends from outside . and hoary nodens raised a howl of triumph when nyarlathotep , close on his quarry , stopped baffled by a glare that seared his formless hunting-horrors to grey dust . randolph carter had indeed descended at last the wide marmoreal flights to his marvellous city , for he was come again to the fair new england world that had wrought him .\\n\\nso to the organ chords of morning\\'s myriad whistles , and dawn\\'s blaze thrown dazzling through purple panes by the great gold dome of the state house on the hill , randolph carter leaped shoutingly awake within his boston room . birds sang in hidden gardens and the perfume of trellised vines came wistful from arbours his grandfather had reared . beauty and light glowed from classic mantel and carven cornice and walls grotesquely figured , while a sleek black cat rose yawning from hearthside sleep that his master\\'s start and shriek had disturbed . and vast infinities away , past the gate of deeper slumber and the enchanted wood and the garden lands and the cerenarian sea and the twilight reaches of inquanok , the crawling chaos nyarlathotep strode brooding into the onyx castle atop unknown kadath in the cold waste , and taunted insolently the mild gods of earth whom he had snatched abruptly from their scented revels in the marvellous sunset city .\\n', shape=(), dtype=string)\n",
            "tf.Tensor(b'from beyond\\n\\nthat crawford tillinghast should ever have studied science and philosophy was a mistake . these things should be left to the frigid and impersonal investigator for they offer two equally tragic alternatives to the man of feeling and action ; despair , if he fail in his quest , and terrors unutterable and unimaginable if he succeed . tillinghast had once been the prey of failure , solitary and melancholy ; but now i knew , with nauseating fears of my own , that he was the prey of success . i had indeed warned him ten weeks before , when he burst forth with his tale of what he felt himself about to discover . he had been flushed and excited then , talking in a high and unnatural , though always pedantic , voice .\\n\\n\"what do we know ,\" he had said , \"of the world and the universe about us ? our means of receiving impressions are absurdly few , and our notions of surrounding objects infinitely narrow . we see things only as we are constructed to see them , and can gain no idea of their absolute nature . with five feeble senses we pretend to comprehend the boundlessly complex cosmos , yet other beings with wider , stronger , or different range of senses might not only see very differently the things we see , but might see and study whole worlds of matter , energy , and life which lie close at hand yet can never be detected with the senses we have . i have always believed that such strange , inaccessible worlds exist at our very elbows , and now i believe i have found a way to break dawn the barriers . i am not joking . within twenty-four hours that machine near the table will generate waves acting on unrecognized sense organs that exist in us as atrophied or rudimentary vestiges . those waves will open up to us many vistas unknown to man and several unknown to anything we consider organic life . we shall see that at which dogs howl in the dark , and that at which cats prick up their ears after midnight . we shall see these things , and other things which no breathing creature has yet seen . we shall overleap time , space , and dimensions , and without bodily motion peer to the bottom of creation .\"\\n\\nwhen tillinghast said these things i remonstrated , for i knew him well enough to be frightened rather than amused ; but he was a fanatic , and drove me from the house . now he was no less a fanatic , but his desire to speak had conquered his resentment , and he had written me imperatively in a hand i could scarcely recognize . as i entered the abode of the friend so suddenly metamorphosed to a shivering gargoyle , i became infected with the terror which seemed stalking in all the shadows . the words and beliefs expressed ten weeks before seemed bodied forth in the darkness beyond the small circle of candle light , and i sickened at the hollow , altered voice of my host . i wished the servants were about , and did not like it when he said they had all left three days previously . it seemed strange that old gregory , at least , should desert his master without telling as tried a friend as i . it was he who had given me all the information i had of tillinghast after i was repulsed in rage .\\n\\nyet i soon subordinated all my fears to my growing curiosity and fascination . just what crawford tillinghast now wished of me i could only guess , but that he had some stupendous secret or discovery to impart , i could not doubt . before i had protested at his unnatural pryings into the unthinkable ; now that he had evidently succeeded to some degree i almost shared his spirit , terrible though the cost of victory appeared . up through the dark emptiness of the house i followed the bobbing candle in the hand of this shaking parody on man . the electricity seemed to be turned off , and when i asked my guide he said it was for a definite reason .\\n\\n\"it would be too much . . .i would not dare ,\" he continued to mutter . i especially noted his new habit of muttering , for it was not like him to talk to himself . we entered the laboratory in the attic , and i observed that detestable electrical machine , glowing with a sickly , sinister violet luminosity . it was connected with a powerful chemical battery , but seemed to be receiving no current ; for i recalled that in its experimental stage it had sputtered and purred when in action . in reply to my question tillinghast mumbled that this permanent glow was not electrical in any sense that i could understand .\\n\\nhe now seated me near the machine , so that it was on my right , and turned a switch somewhere below the crowning cluster of glass bulbs . the usual sputtering began , turned to a whine , and terminated in a drone so soft as to suggest a return to silence . meanwhile the luminosity increased , waned again , then assumed a pale , outr\\xc3\\xa8 colour or blend of colours which i could neither place nor describe . tillinghast had been watching me , and noted my puzzled expression .\\n\\n\"do you know what that is ?\" he whispered , \"that is ultra-violet .\"he chuckled oddly at my surprise . \"you thought ultra-violet was invisible , and so it is--but you can see that and many other invisible things now .\\n\\n\"listen to me ! the waves from that thing are waking a thousand sleeping senses in us ; senses which we inherit from aeons of evolution from the state of detached electrons to the state of organic humanity . i have seen the truth , and i intend to show it to you . do you wonder how it will seem ? i will tell you .\"here tillinghast seated himself directly opposite me , blowing out his candle and staring hideously into my eyes . \"your existing sense-organs--ears first , i think--will pick up many of the impressions , for they are closely connected with the dormant organs . then there will be others . you have heard of the pineal gland ? i laugh at the shallow endocrinologist , fellow-dupe and fellow-parvenu of the freudian . that gland is the great sense organ of organs--i have found out . it is like sight in the end , and transmits visual pictures to the brain . if you are normal , that is the way you ought to get most of it . . .i mean get most of the evidence from beyond .\"\\n\\ni looked about the immense attic room with the sloping south wall , dimly lit by rays which the every day eye cannot see . the far corners were all shadows and the whole place took on a hazy unreality which obscured its nature and invited the imagination to symbolism and phantasm . during the interval that tillinghast was long silent i fancied myself in some vast incredible temple of long-dead gods ; some vague edifice of innumerable black stone columns reaching up from a floor of damp slabs to a cloudy height beyond the range of my vision . the picture was very vivid for a while , but gradually gave way to a more horrible conception ; that of utter , absolute solitude in infinite , sightless , soundless space . there seemed to be a void , and nothing more , and i felt a childish fear which prompted me to draw from my hip pocket the revolver i carried after dark since the night i was held up in east providence . then from the farthermost regions of remoteness , the sound softly glided into existence . it was infinitely faint , subtly vibrant , and unmistakably musical , but held a quality of surpassing wildness which made its impact feel like a delicate torture of my whole body . i felt sensations like those one feels when accidentally scratching ground glass . simultaneously there developed something like a cold draught , which apparently swept past me from the direction of the distant sound . as i waited breathlessly i perceived that both sound and wind were increasing ; the effect being to give me an odd notion of myself as tied to a pair of rails in the path of a gigantic approaching locomotive . i began to speak to tillinghast , and as i did so all the unusual impressions abruptly vanished . i saw only the man , the glowing machines , and the dim apartment . tillinghast was grinning repulsively at the revolver which i had almost unconsciously drawn , but from his expression i was sure he had seen and heard as much as i , if not a great deal more . i whispered what i had experienced and he bade me to remain as quiet and receptive as possible .\\n\\n\"don\\'t move ,\" he cautioned , \"for in these rays we are able to be seen as well as to see . i told you the servants left , but i didn\\'t tell you how . it was that thick-witted house-keeper--she turned on the lights downstairs after i had warned her not to , and the wires picked up sympathetic vibrations . it must have been frightful--i could hear the screams up here in spite of all i was seeing and hearing from another direction , and later it was rather awful to find those empty heaps of clothes around the house . mrs . updike\\'s clothes were close to the front hall switch--that\\'s how i know she did it . it got them all . but so long as we don\\'t move we\\'re fairly safe . remember we\\'re dealing with a hideous world in which we are practically helpless . . .keep still !\"\\n\\nthe combined shock of the revelation and of the abrupt command gave me a kind of paralysis , and in my terror my mind again opened to the impressions coming from what tillinghast called \"beyond .\"i was now in a vortex of sound and motion , with confused pictures before my eyes . i saw the blurred outlines of the room , but from some point in space there seemed to be pouring a seething column of unrecognizable shapes or clouds , penetrating the solid roof at a point ahead and to the right of me . then i glimpsed the temple-like effect again , but this time the pillars reached up into an aerial ocean of light , which sent down one blinding beam along the path of the cloudy column i had seen before . after that the scene was almost wholly kaleidoscopic , and in the jumble of sights , sounds , and unidentified sense-impressions i felt that i was about to dissolve or in some way lose the solid form . one definite flash i shall always remember . i seemed for an instant to behold a patch of strange night sky filled with shining , revolving spheres , and as it receded i saw that the glowing suns formed a constellation or galaxy of settled shape ; this shape being the distorted face of crawford tillinghast . at another time i felt the huge animate things brushing past me and occasionally walking or drifting through my supposedly solid body , and thought i saw tillinghast look at them as though his better trained senses could catch them visually . i recalled what he had said of the pineal gland , and wondered what he saw with this preternatural eye .\\n\\nsuddenly i myself became possessed of a kind of augmented sight . over and above the luminous and shadowy chaos arose a picture which , though vague , held the elements of consistency and permanence . it was indeed somewhat familiar , for the unusual part was superimposed upon the usual terrestrial scene much as a cinema view may be thrown upon the painted curtain of a theater . i saw the attic laboratory , the electrical machine , and the unsightly form of tillinghast opposite me ; but of all the space unoccupied by familiar objects not one particle was vacant . indescribable shapes both alive and otherwise were mixed in disgusting disarray , and close to every known thing were whole worlds of alien , unknown entities . it likewise seemed that all the known things entered into the composition of other unknown things and vice versa . foremost among the living objects were inky , jellyfish monstrosities which flabbily quivered in harmony with the vibrations from the machine . they were present in loathsome profusion , and i saw to my horror that they overlapped ; that they were semi-fluid and capable of passing through one another and through what we know as solids . these things were never still , but seemed ever floating about with some malignant purpose . sometimes they appeared to devour one another , the attacker launching itself at its victim and instantaneously obliterating the latter from sight . shudderingly i felt that i knew what had obliterated the unfortunate servants , and could not exclude the thing from my mind as i strove to observe other properties of the newly visible world that lies unseen around us . but tillinghast had been watching me and was speaking .\\n\\n\"you see them ? you see them ? you see the things that float and flop about you and through you every moment of your life ? you see the creatures that form what men call the pure air and the blue sky ? have i not succeeded in breaking down the barrier ; have i not shown you worlds that no other living men have seen ?\" i heard his scream through the horrible chaos , and looked at the wild face thrust so offensively close to mine . his eyes were pits of flame , and they glared at me with what i now saw was overwhelming hatred . the machine droned detestably .\\n\\n\"you think those floundering things wiped out the servants ? fool , they are harmless ! but the servants are gone , aren\\'t they ? you tried to stop me ; you discouraged me when i needed every drop of encouragement i could get ; you were afraid of the cosmic truth , you damned coward , but now i\\'ve got you ! what swept up the servants ? what made them scream so loud ? . . .don\\'t know , eh ! you\\'ll know soon enough . look at me--listen to what i say--do you suppose there are really any such things as time and magnitude ? do you fancy there are such things as form or matter ? i tell you , i have struck depths that your little brain can\\'t picture . i have seen beyond the bounds of infinity and drawn down demons from the stars . . .i have harnessed the shadows that stride from world to world to sow death and madness . . .space belongs to me , do you hear ? things are hunting me now--the things that devour and dissolve--but i know how to elude them . it is you they will get , as they got the servants . . .stirring , dear sir ? i told you it was dangerous to move , i have saved you so far by telling you to keep still--saved you to see more sights and to listen to me . if you had moved , they would have been at you long ago . don\\'t worry , they won\\'t hurt you . they didn\\'t hurt the servants--it was the seeing that made the poor devils scream so . my pets are not pretty , for they come out of places where aesthetic standards are--very different . disintegration is quite painless , i assure you--but i want you to see them . i almost saw them , but i knew how to stop . you are curious ? i always knew you were no scientist . trembling , eh . trembling with anxiety to see the ultimate things i have discovered . why don\\'t you move , then ? tired ? well , don\\'t worry , my friend , for they are coming . . .look , look , curse you , look . . .it\\'s just over your left shoulder . . .\"\\n\\nwhat remains to be told is very brief , and may be familiar to you from the newspaper accounts . the police heard a shot in the old tillinghast house and found us there--tillinghast dead and me unconscious . they arrested me because the revolver was in my hand , but released me in three hours , after they found it was apoplexy which had finished tillinghast and saw that my shot had been directed at the noxious machine which now lay hopelessly shattered on the laboratory floor . i did not tell very much of what i had seen , for i feared the coroner would be skeptical ; but from the evasive outline i did give , the doctor told me that i had undoubtedly been hypnotized by the vindictive and homicidal madman .\\n\\ni wish i could believe that doctor . it would help my shaky nerves if i could dismiss what i now have to think of the air and the sky about and above me . i never feel alone or comfortable , and a hideous sense of pursuit sometimes comes chillingly on me when i am weary . what prevents me from believing the doctor is one simple fact--that the police never found the bodies of those servants whom they say crawford tillinghast murdered .\\n', shape=(), dtype=string)\n",

is , but we suspect it has something to do with what he did . we even avoid looking at it very steadily .\"\\n\\nafter a time the man left me alone in the attic room . it was very dingy and dusty , and only primitively furnished , but it had a neatness which showed it was not a slum-denizen\\'s quarters . there were shelves full of theological and classical books , and another bookcase containing treatises on magic--paracelsus , albertus magnus , trithemius , hermes trismegistus , borellus , and others in a strange alphabet whose titles i could not decipher . the furniture was very plain . there was a door , but it led only into a closet . the only egress was the aperture in the floor up to which the crude , steep staircase led . the windows were of bull\\'s-eye pattern , and the black oak beams bespoke unbelievable antiquity . plainly , this house was of the old world . i seemed to know where i was , but cannot recall what i then knew . certainly the town was not london . my impression is of a small seaport .\\n\\nthe small object on the table fascinated me intensely . i seemed to know what to do with it , for i drew a pocket electric light--or what looked like one--out of my pocket and nervously tested its flashes . the light was not white but violet , and seemed less like true light than like some radioactive bombardment . i recall that i did not regard it as a common flashlight--indeed , i had a common flashlight in another pocket .\\n\\nit was getting dark , and the ancient roofs and chimney-pots outside looked very queer through the bull\\'s-eye window-panes . finally i summoned up courage and propped the small object up on the table against a book--then turned the rays of the peculiar violet light upon it . the light seemed now to be more like a rain of hail or small violet particles than like a continuous beam . as the particles struck the glassy surface at the center of the strange device , they seemed to produce a crackling noise like the sputtering of a vacuum tube through which sparks are passed . the dark glassy surface displayed a pinkish glow , and a vague white shape seemed to be taking form at its center . then i noticed that i was not alone in the room--and put the ray--projector back in my pocket .\\n\\nbut the newcomer did not speak--nor did i hear any sound whatever during all the immediately following moments . everything was shadowy pantomime , as if seen at a vast distance through some intervening haze--although on the other hand the newcomer and all subsequent comers loomed large and close , as if both near and distant , according to some abnormal geometry .\\n\\nthe newcomer was a thin , dark man of medium height attired in the clerical garb of the anglican church . he was apparently about thirty years old , with a sallow , olive complexion and fairly good features , but an abnormally high forehead . his black hair was well cut and neatly brushed , and he was clean-shaven though blue-chinned with a heavy growth of beard . he wore rimless spectacles with steel bows . his build and lower facial features were like other clergymen i had seen , but he had a vastly higher forehead , and was darker and more intelligent-looking--also more subtly and concealedly evil-looking . at the present moment--having just lighted a faint oil lamp--he looked nervous , and before i knew it he was casting all his magical books into a fireplace on the window side of the room (where the wall slanted sharply) which i had not noticed before . the flames devoured the volumes greedily--leaping up in strange colors and emitting indescribably hideous odors as the strangely hieroglyphed leaves and wormy bindings succumbed to the devastating element . all at once i saw there were others in the room--grave-looking men in clerical costume , one of whom wore the bands and knee-breeches of a bishop . though i could hear nothing , i could see that they were bringing a decision of vast import to the first-comer . they seemed to hate and fear him at the same time , and he seemed to return these sentiments . his face set itself into a grim expression , but i could see his right hand shaking as he tried to grip the back of a chair . the bishop pointed to the empty case and to the fireplace (where the flames had died down amidst a charred , non-committal mass) , and seemed filled with a peculiar loathing . the first-comer then gave a wry smile and reached out with his left hand toward the small object on the table . everyone then seemed frightened . the procession of clerics began filing down the steep stairs through the trapdoor in the floor , turning and making menacing gestures as they left . the bishop was last to go .\\n\\nthe first-comer now went to a cupboard on the inner side of the room and extracted a coil of rope . mounting a chair , he attached one end of the rope to a hook in the great exposed central beam of black oak , and began making a noose with the other end . realizing he was about to hang himself , i started forward to dissuade or save him . he saw me and ceased his preparations , looking at me with a kind of triumph which puzzled and disturbed me . he slowly stepped down from the chair and began gliding toward me with a positively wolfish grin on his dark , thin-lipped face .\\n\\ni felt somehow in deadly peril , and drew out the peculiar ray-projector as a weapon of defense . why i thought it could help me , i do not know . i turned it on--full in his face , and saw the sallow features glow first with violet and then with pinkish light . his expression of wolfish exultation began to be crowded aside by a look of profound fear--which did not , however , wholly displace the exultation . he stopped in his tracks--then , flailing his arms wildly in the air , began to stagger backwards . i saw he was edging toward the open stair-well in the floor , and tried to shout a warning , but he did not hear me . in another instant he had lurched backward through the opening and was lost to view .\\n\\ni found difficulty in moving toward the stair-well , but when i did get there i found no crushed body on the floor below . instead there was a clatter of people coming up with lanterns , for the spell of phantasmal silence had broken , and i once more heard sounds and saw figures as normally tri-dimensional . something had evidently drawn a crowd to this place . had there been a noise i had not heard ?\\n\\npresently the two people (simple villagers , apparently) farthest in the lead saw me--and stood paralyzed . one of them shrieked loudly and reverberantly :\\n\\n\"ahrrh ! . . .it be\\'ee , zur ? again ?\"\\n\\nthen they all turned and fled frantically . all , that is , but one . when the crowd was gone i saw the grave-bearded man who had brought me to this place--standing alone with a lantern . he was gazing at me gaspingly and fascinatedly , but did not seem afraid . then he began to ascend the stairs , and joined me in the attic . he spoke :\\n\\n\"so you didn\\'t let it alone ! i\\'m sorry . i know what has happened . it happened once before , but the man got frightened and shot himself . you ought not to have made him come back . you know what he wants . but you mustn\\'t get frightened like the other man he got . something very strange and terrible has happened to you , but it didn\\'t get far enough to hurt your mind and personality . if you\\'ll keep cool , and accept the need for making certain radical readjustments in your life , you can keep right on enjoying the world , and the fruits of your scholarship . but you can\\'t live here--and i don\\'t think you\\'ll wish to go back to london . i\\'d advise america .\\n\\n\"you mustn\\'t try anything more with that--thing . nothing can be put back now . it would only make matters worse to do--or summon--anything . you are not as badly off as you might be--but you must get out of here at once and stay away .

but in a new country you can get used to it . there\\'s a mirror up at the other end of the room , and i\\'m going to take you to it . you\\'ll get a shock--though you will see nothing repulsive .\"\\n\\ni was now shaking with a deadly fear , and the bearded man almost had to hold me up as he walked me across the room to the mirror , the faint lamp (i .e . , that formerly on the table , not the still fainter lantern he had brought) in his free hand . this is what i saw in the glass :\\n\\na thin , dark man of medium stature attired in the clerical garb of the anglican church , apparently about thirty , and with rimless , steel--bowed glasses glistening beneath a sallow , olive forehead of abnormal height .\\n\\nit was the silent first-comer who had burned his books .\\n\\nfor all the

and concerned means for operating the organic machinery of mankind by calculated chemical action after the failure of natural processes . in his experiments with various animating solutions , he had killed and treated immense numbers of rabbits , guinea-pigs , cats , dogs , and monkeys , till he had become the prime nuisance of the college . several times he had actually obtained signs of life in animals supposedly dead ; in many cases violent signs but he soon saw that the perfection of his process , if indeed possible , would necessarily involve a lifetime of research . it likewise became clear that , since the same solution never worked alike on different organic species , he would require human subjects for further and more specialised progress . it was here that he first came into conflict with the college authorities , and was debarred from future experiments by no less a dignitary than the dean of the medical school himself--the learned and benevolent dr . allan halsey , whose work in behalf of the stricken is recalled by every old resident of arkham .\\n\\ni had always been exceptionally tolerant of west\\'s pursuits , and we frequently discussed his theories , whose ramifications and corollaries were almost infinite . holding with haeckel that all life is a chemical and physical process , and that the so-called \"soul\" is a myth , my friend believed that artificial reanimation of the dead can depend only on the condition of the tissues ; and that unless actual decomposition has set in , a corpse fully equipped with organs may with suitable measures be set going again in the peculiar fashion known as life . that the psychic or intellectual life might be impaired by the slight deterioration of sensitive brain-cells which even a short period of death would be apt to cause , west fully realised . it had at first been his hope to find a reagent which would restore vitality before the actual advent of death , and only repeated failures on animals had shewn him that the natural and artificial life-motions were incompatible . he then sought extreme freshness in his specimens , injecting his solutions into the blood immediately after the extinction of life . it was this circumstance which made the professors so carelessly sceptical , for they felt that true death had not occurred in any case . they did not stop to view the matter closely and reasoningly .\\n\\nit was not long after the faculty had interdicted his work that west confided to me his resolution to get fresh human bodies in some manner , and continue in secret the experiments he could no longer perform openly . to hear him discussing ways and means was rather ghastly , for at the college we had never procured anatomical specimens ourselves . whenever the morgue proved inadequate , two local negroes attended to this matter , and they were seldom questioned . west was then a small , slender , spectacled youth with delicate features , yellow hair , pale blue eyes , and a soft voice , and it was uncanny to hear him dwelling on the relative merits of christchurch cemetery and the potter\\'s field . we finally decided on the potter\\'s field , because practically every body in christchurch was embalmed ; a thing of course ruinous to west\\'s researches .\\n\\ni was by this time his active and enthralled assistant , and helped him make all his decisions , not only concerning the source of bodies but concerning a suitable place for our loathsome work . it was i who thought of the deserted chapman farmhouse beyond meadow hill , where we fitted up on the ground floor an operating room and a laboratory , each with dark curtains to conceal our midnight doings . the place was far from any road , and in sight of no other house , yet precautions were none the less necessary ; since rumours of strange lights , started by chance nocturnal roamers , would soon bring disaster on our enterprise . it was agreed to call the whole thing a chemical laboratory if discovery should occur . gradually we equipped our sinister haunt of science with materials either purchased in boston or quietly borrowed from the college--materials carefully made unrecognisable save to expert eyes--and provided spades and picks for the many burials we should have to make in the cellar . at the college we used an incinerator , but the apparatus was too costly for our unauthorised laboratory . bodies were always a nuisance--even the small guinea-pig bodies from the slight clandestine experiments in west\\'s room at the boarding-house .\\n\\nwe followed the local death-notices like ghouls , for our specimens demanded particular qualities . what we wanted were corpses interred soon after death and without artificial preservation ; preferably free from malforming disease , and certainly with all organs present . accident victims were our best hope . not for many weeks did we hear of anything suitable ; though we talked with morgue and hospital authorities , ostensibly in the college\\'s interest , as often as we could without exciting suspicion . we found that the college had first choice in every case , so that it might be necessary to remain in arkham during the summer , when only the limited summer-school classes were held . in the end , though , luck favoured us ; for one day we heard of an almost ideal case in the potter\\'s field ; a brawny young workman drowned only the morning before in summer\\'s pond , and buried at the town\\'s expense without delay or embalming . that afternoon we found the new grave , and determined to begin work soon after midnight .\\n\\nit was a repulsive task that we undertook in the black small hours , even though we lacked at that time the special horror of graveyards which later experiences brought to us . we carried spades and oil dark lanterns , for although electric torches were then manufactured , they were not as satisfactory as the tungsten contrivances of today . the process of unearthing was slow and sordid--it might have been gruesomely poetical if we had been artists instead of scientists--and we were glad when our spades struck wood . when the pine box was fully uncovered , west scrambled down and removed the lid , dragging out and propping up the contents . i reached down and hauled the contents out of the grave , and then both toiled hard to restore the spot to its former appearance . the affair made us rather nervous , especially the stiff form and vacant face of our first trophy , but we managed to remove all traces of our visit . when we had patted down the last shovelful of earth , we put the specimen in a canvas sack and set out for the old chapman place beyond meadow hill .\\n\\non an improvised dissecting-table in the old farmhouse , by the light of a powerful acetylene lamp , the specimen was not very spectral looking . it had been a sturdy and apparently unimaginative youth of wholesome plebeian type--large-framed , grey-eyed , and brown-haired--a sound animal without psychological subtleties , and probably having vital processes of the simplest and healthiest sort . now , with the eyes closed , it looked more asleep than dead ; though the expert test of my friend soon left no doubt on that score . we had at last what west had always longed for--a real dead man of the ideal kind , ready for the solution as prepared according to the most careful calculations and theories for human use . the tension on our part became very great . we knew that there was scarcely a chance for anything like complete success , and could not avoid hideous fears at possible grotesque results of partial animation . especially were we apprehensive concerning the mind and impulses of the creature , since in the space following death some of the more delicate cerebral cells might well have suffered deterioration . i , myself , still held some curious notions about the traditional \"soul\" of man , and felt an awe at the secrets that might be told by one returning from the dead . i wondered what sights this placid youth might have seen in inaccessible spheres , and what he could relate if fully restored to life . but my wonder was not overwhelming , since for the most part i shared the materialism of my friend . he was calmer than i as he forced a large quantity of his fluid into a vein of the body\\'s arm , immediately binding the incision securely .\\n\\nthe waiting was gruesome , but west never faltered . every now and then he applied his stethoscope to the specimen , and bore the negative results philosophically . after about three-quarters of an hour without the least sign of life he disappointedly pronounced the solution inadequate , but determined to make the most of his opportunity and try one change in the formula before disposing of his ghastly prize . we had that afternoon dug a grave in the cellar , and would have to fill it by dawn--for although we had fixed a lock on the house , we wished to shun even the remotest risk of a ghoulish discovery . besides , the body would not be even approximately fresh the next night . so taking the solitary acetylene lamp into the adjacent laboratory , we left our silent guest on the slab in the dark , and bent every energy to the mixing of a new solution ; the weighing and measuring supervised by west with an almost fanatical care .\\n\\nthe awful event was very sudden , and wholly unexpected . i was pouring something from one test-tube to another , and west was busy over the alcohol blast-lamp which had to answer for a bunsen burner in this gasless edifice , when from the pitch-black room we had left there burst the most appalling and daemoniac succession of cries that either of us had ever heard . not more unutterable could have been the chaos of hellish sound if the pit itself had opened to release the agony of the damned , for in one inconceivable cacophony was centered all the supernal terror and unnatural despair of animate nature . human it could not have been--it is not in man to make such sounds--and without a thought of our late employment or its possible discovery , both west and i leaped to the nearest window like stricken animals ; overturning tubes , lamp , and retorts , and vaulting madly into the starred abyss of the rural night . i think we screamed ourselves as we stumbled frantically toward the town , though as we reached the outskirts we put on a semblance of restraint--just enough to seem like belated revellers staggering home from a debauch .\\n\\nwe did not separate , but managed to get to west\\'s room , where we whispered with the gas up until dawn . by then we had calmed ourselves a little with rational theories and plans for investigation , so that we could sleep through the day--classes being disregarded . but that evening two items in the paper , wholly unrelated , made it again impossible for us to sleep . the old deserted chapman house had inexplicably burned to an amorphous heap of ashes ; that we could understand because of the upset lamp . also , an attempt had been made to disturb a new grave in the potter\\'s field , as if by futile and spadeless clawing at the earth . that we could not understand , for we had patted down the mould very carefully .\\n\\nand for seventeen years after that west would look frequently over his shoulder , and complain of fancied footsteps behind him . now he has disappeared .\\n\\npart ii : the plague-daemon\\n\\ni shall never forget that hideous summer sixteen years ago , when like a noxious afrite from the halls of eblis typhoid stalked leeringly through arkham . it is by that satanic scourge that most recall the year , for truly terror brooded with bat-wings over the piles of coffins in the tombs of christchurch cemetery ; yet for me there is a greater horror in that time--a horror known to me alone now that herbert west has disappeared .\\n\\nwest and i were doing post-graduate work in summer classes at the medical school of miskatonic university , and my friend had attained a wide notoriety because of his experiments leading toward the revivification of the dead . after the scientific slaughter of uncounted small animals the freakish work had ostensibly stopped by order of our sceptical dean , dr . allan halsey ; though west had continued to perform certain secret tests in his dingy boarding-house room , and had on one terrible and unforgettable occasion taken a human body from its grave in the potter\\'s field to a deserted farmhouse beyond meadow hill .\\n\\ni was with him on that odious occasion , and saw him inject into the still veins the elixir which he thought would to some extent restore life\\'s chemical and physical processes . it had ended horribly--in a delirium of fear which we gradually came to attribute to our own overwrought nerves--and west had never afterward been able to shake off a maddening sensation of being haunted and hunted . the body had not been quite fresh enough ; it is obvious that to restore normal mental attributes a body must be very fresh indeed ; and the burning of the old house had prevented us from burying the thing . it would have been better if we could have known it was underground .\\n\\nafter that experience west had dropped his researches for some time ; but as the zeal of the born scientist slowly returned , he again became importunate with the college faculty , pleading for the use of the dissecting-room and of fresh human specimens for the work he regarded as so overwhelmingly important . his pleas , however , were wholly in vain ; for the decision of dr . halsey was inflexible , and the other professors all endorsed the verdict of their leader . in the radical theory of reanimation they saw nothing but the immature vagaries of a youthful enthusiast whose slight form , yellow hair , spectacled blue eyes , and soft voice gave no hint of the supernormal--almost diabolical--power of the cold brain within . i can see him now as he was then--and i shiver . he grew sterner of face , but never elderly . and now sefton asylum has had the mishap and west has vanished .\\n\\nwest clashed disagreeably with dr . halsey near the end of our last undergraduate term in a wordy dispute that did less credit to him than to the kindly dean in point of courtesy . he felt that he was needlessly and irrationally retarded in a supremely great work ; a work which he could of course conduct to suit himself in later years , but which he wished to begin while still possessed of the exceptional facilities of the university . that the tradition-bound elders should ignore his singular results on animals , and persist in their denial of the possibility of reanimation , was inexpressibly disgusting and almost incomprehensible to a youth of west\\'s logical temperament . only greater maturity could help him understand the chronic mental limitations of the \"professor-doctor\" type--the product of generations of pathetic puritanism ; kindly , conscientious , and sometimes gentle and amiable , yet always narrow , intolerant , custom-ridden , and lacking in perspective . age has more charity for these incomplete yet high--souled characters , whose worst real vice is timidity , and who are ultimately punished by general ridicule for their intellectual sins--sins like ptolemaism , calvinism , anti-darwinism , anti-nietzscheism , and every sort of sabbatarianism and sumptuary legislation . west , young despite his marvellous scientific acquirements , had scant patience with good dr . halsey and his erudite colleagues ; and nursed an increasing resentment , coupled with a desire to prove his theories to these obtuse worthies in some striking and dramatic fashion . like most youths , he indulged in elaborate daydreams of revenge , triumph , and final magnanimous forgiveness .\\n\\nand then had come the scourge , grinning and lethal , from the nightmare caverns of tartarus . west and i had graduated about the time of its beginning , but had remained for additional work at the summer school , so that we were in arkham when it broke with full daemoniac fury upon the town . though not as yet licenced physicians , we now had our degrees , and were pressed frantically into public service as the numbers of the stricken grew . the situation was almost past management , and deaths ensued too frequently for the local undertakers fully to handle . burials without embalming were made in rapid succession , and even the christchurch cemetery receiving tomb was crammed with coffins of the unembalmed dead . this circumstance was not without effect on west , who thought often of the irony of the situation--so many fresh specimens , yet none for his persecuted researches ! we were frightfully overworked , and the terrific mental and nervous strain made my friend brood morbidly .\\n\\nbut west\\'s gentle enemies were no less harassed with prostrating duties . college had all but closed , and every doctor of the medical faculty was helping to fight the typhoid plague . dr . halsey in particular had distinguished himself in sacrificing service , applying his extreme skill with whole-hearted energy to cases which many others shunned because of danger or apparent hopelessness . before a month was over the fearless dean had become a popular hero , though he seemed unconscious of his fame as he struggled to keep from collapsing with physical fatigue and nervous exhaustion . west could not withhold admiration for the fortitude of his foe , but because of this was even more determined to prove to him the truth of his amazing doctrines . taking advantage of the disorganisation of both college work and municipal health regulations , he managed to get a recently deceased body smuggled into the university dissecting-room one night , and in my presence injected a new modification of his solution . the thing actually opened its eyes , but only stared at the ceiling with a look of soul-petrifying horror before collapsing into an inertness from which nothing could rouse it . west said it was not fresh enough--the hot summer air does not favour corpses . that time we were almost caught before we incinerated the thing , and west doubted the advisability of repeating his daring misuse of the college laboratory .\\n\\nthe peak of the epidemic was reached in august . west and i were almost dead , and dr . halsey did die on the 14th . the students all attended the hasty funeral on the 15th , and bought an impressive wreath , though the latter was quite overshadowed by the tributes sent by wealthy arkham citizens and by the municipality itself . it was almost a public affair , for the dean had surely been a public benefactor . after the entombment we were all somewhat depressed , and spent the afternoon at the bar of the commercial house ; where west , though shaken by the death of his chief opponent , chilled the rest of us with references to his notorious theories . most of the students went home , or to various duties , as the evening advanced ; but west persuaded me to aid him in \"making a night of it .\"west\\'s landlady saw us arrive at his room about two in the morning , with a third man between us ; and told her husband that we had all evidently dined and wined rather well .\\n\\napparently this acidulous matron was right ; for about 3 a .m . the whole house was aroused by cries coming from west\\'s room , where when they broke down the door , they found the two of us unconscious on the blood-stained carpet , beaten , scratched , and mauled , and with the broken remnants of west\\'s bottles and instruments around us . only an open window told what had become of our assailant , and many wondered how he himself had fared after the terrific leap from the second story to the lawn which he must have made . there were some strange garments in the room , but west upon regaining consciousness said they did not belong to the stranger , but were specimens collected for bacteriological analysis in the course of investigations on the transmission of germ diseases . he ordered them burnt as soon as possible in the capacious fireplace . to the police we both declared ignorance of our late companion\\'s identity . he was , west nervously said , a congenial stranger whom we had met at some downtown bar of uncertain location . we had all been rather jovial , and west and i did not wish to have our pugnacious companion hunted down .\\n\\nthat same night saw the beginning of the second arkham horror--the horror that to me eclipsed the plague itself . christchurch cemetery was the scene of a terrible killing ; a watchman having been clawed to death in a manner not only too hideous for description , but raising a doubt as to the human agency of the deed . the victim had been seen alive considerably after midnight--the dawn revealed the unutterable thing . the manager of a circus at the neighbouring town of bolton was questioned , but he swore that no beast had at any time escaped from its cage . those who found the body noted a trail of blood leading to the receiving tomb , where a small pool of red lay on the concrete just outside the gate . a fainter trail led away toward the woods , but it soon gave out .\\n\\nthe next night devils danced on the roofs of arkham , and unnatural madness howled in the wind . through the fevered town had crept a curse which some said was greater than the plague , and which some whispered was the embodied daemon-soul of the plague itself . eight houses were entered by a nameless thing which strewed red death in its wake--in all , seventeen maimed and shapeless remnants of bodies were left behind by the voiceless , sadistic monster that crept abroad . a few persons had half seen it in the dark , and said it was white and like a malformed ape or anthropomorphic fiend . it had not left behind quite all that it had attacked , for sometimes it had been hungry . the number it had killed was fourteen ; three of the bodies had been in stricken homes and had not been alive .\\n\\non the third night frantic bands of searchers , led by the police , captured it in a house on crane street near the miskatonic campus . they had organised the quest with care , keeping in touch by means of volunteer telephone stations , and when someone in the college district had reported hearing a scratching at a shuttered window , the net was quickly spread . on account of the general alarm and precautions , there were only two more victims , and the capture was effected without major casualties . the thing was finally stopped by a bullet , though not a fatal one , and was rushed to the local hospital amidst universal excitement and loathing .\\n\\nfor it had been a man . this much was clear despite the nauseous eyes , the voiceless simianism , and the daemoniac savagery . they dressed its wound and carted it to the asylum at sefton , where it beat its head against the walls of a padded cell for sixteen years--until the recent mishap , when it escaped under circumstances that few like to mention . what had most disgusted the searchers of arkham was the thing they noticed when the monster\\'s face was cleaned--the mocking , unbelievable resemblance to a learned and self-sacrificing martyr who had been entombed but three days before--the late dr . allan halsey , public benefactor and dean of the medical school of miskatonic university .\\n\\nto the vanished herbert west and to me the disgust and horror were supreme . i shudder tonight as i think of it ; shudder even more than i did that morning when west muttered through his bandages , \"damn it , it wasn\\'t quite fresh enough !\"\\n\\npart iii : six shots by moonlight\\n\\npublished april 1922 in home brew vol . 1 , no . 3 , p . 21-26 .\\n\\nit is uncommon to fire all six shots of a revolver with great suddenness when one would probably be sufficient , but many things in the life of herbert west were uncommon . it is , for instance , not often that a young physician leaving college is obliged to conceal the principles which guide his selection of a home and office , yet that was the case with herbert west . when he and i obtained our degrees at the medical school of miskatonic university , and sought to relieve our poverty by setting up as general practitioners , we took great care not to say that we chose our house because it was fairly well isolated , and as near as possible to the potter\\'s field .\\n\\nreticence such as this is seldom without a cause , nor indeed was ours ; for our requirements were those resulting from a life-work distinctly unpopular . outwardly we were doctors only , but beneath the surface were aims of far greater and more terrible moment--for the essence of herbert west\\'s existence was a quest amid black and forbidden realms of the unknown , in which he hoped to uncover the secret of life and restore to perpetual animation the graveyard\\'s cold clay . such a quest demands strange materials , among them fresh human bodies ; and in order to keep supplied with these indispensable things one must live quietly and not far from a place of informal interment .\\n\\nwest and i had met in college , and i had been the only one to sympathise with his hideous experiments . gradually i had come to be his inseparable assistant , and now that we were out of college we had to keep together . it was not easy to find a good opening for two doctors in company , but finally the influence of the university secured us a practice in bolton--a factory town near arkham , the seat of the college . the bolton worsted mills are the largest in the miskatonic valley , and their polyglot employees are never popular as patients with the local physicians . we chose our house with the greatest care , seizing at last on a rather run-down cottage near the end of pond street ; five numbers from the closest neighbour , and separated from the local potter\\'s field by only a stretch of meadow land , bisected by a narrow neck of the rather dense forest which lies to the north . the distance was greater than we wished , but we could get no nearer house without going on the other side of the field , wholly out of the factory district . we were not much displeased , however , since there were no people between us and our sinister source of supplies . the walk was a trifle long , but we could haul our silent specimens undisturbed .\\n\\nour practice was surprisingly large from the very first--large enough to please most young doctors , and large enough to prove a bore and a burden to students whose real interest lay elsewhere . the mill-hands were of somewhat turbulent inclinations ; and besides their many natural needs , their frequent clashes and stabbing affrays gave us plenty to do . but what actually absorbed our minds was the secret laboratory we had fitted up in the cellar--the laboratory with the long table under the electric lights , where in the small hours of the morning we often injected west\\'s various solutions into the veins of the things we dragged from the potter\\'s field . west was experimenting madly to find something which would start man\\'s vital motions anew after they had been stopped by the thing we call death , but had encountered the most ghastly obstacles . the solution had to be differently compounded for different types--what would serve for guinea-pigs would not serve for human beings , and different human specimens required large modifications .\\n\\nthe bodies had to be exceedingly fresh , or the slight decomposition of brain tissue would render perfect reanimation impossible . indeed , the greatest problem was to get them fresh enough--west had had horrible experiences during his secret college researches with corpses of doubtful vintage . the results of partial or imperfect animation were much more hideous than were the total failures , and we both held fearsome recollections of such things . ever since our first daemoniac session in the deserted farmhouse on meadow hill in arkham , we had felt a brooding menace ; and west , though a calm , blond , blue-eyed scientific automaton in most respects , often confessed to a shuddering sensation of stealthy pursuit . he half felt that he was followed--a psychological delusion of shaken nerves , enhanced by the undeniably disturbing fact that at least one of our reanimated specimens was still alive--a frightful carnivorous thing in a padded cell at sefton . then there was another--our first--whose exact fate we had never learned .\\n\\nwe had fair luck with specimens in bolton--much better than in arkham . we had not been settled a week before we got an accident victim on the very night of burial , and made it open its eyes with an amazingly rational expression before the solution failed . it had lost an arm--if it had been a perfect body we might have succeeded better . between then and the next january we secured three more ; one total failure , one case of marked muscular motion , and one rather shivery thing--it rose of itself and uttered a sound . then came a period when luck was poor ; interments fell off , and those that did occur were of specimens either too diseased or too maimed for use . we kept track of all the deaths and their circumstances with systematic care .\\n\\none march night , however , we unexpectedly obtained a specimen which did not come from the potter\\'s field . in bolton the prevailing spirit of puritanism had outlawed the sport of boxing--with the usual result . surreptitious and ill-conducted bouts among the mill-workers were common , and occasionally professional talent of low grade was imported . this late winter night there had been such a match ; evidently with disastrous results , since two timorous poles had come to us with incoherently whispered entreaties to attend to a very secret and desperate case . we followed them to an abandoned barn , where the remnants of a crowd of frightened foreigners were watching a silent black form on the floor .\\n\\nthe match had been between kid o\\'brien--a lubberly and now quaking youth with a most un-hibernian hooked nose--and buck robinson , \"the harlem smoke .\"the negro had been knocked out , and a moment\\'s examination shewed us that he would permanently remain so . he was a loathsome , gorilla-like thing , with abnormally long arms which i could not help calling fore legs , and a face that conjured up thoughts of unspeakable congo secrets and tom-tom poundings under an eerie moon . the body must have looked even worse in life--but the world holds many ugly things . fear was upon the whole pitiful crowd , for they did not know what the law would exact of them if the affair were not hushed up ; and they were grateful when west , in spite of my involuntary shudders , offered to get rid of the thing quietly--for a purpose i knew too well .\\n\\nthere was bright moonlight over the snowless landscape , but we dressed the thing and carried it home between us through the deserted streets and meadows , as we had carried a similar thing one horrible night in arkham . we approached the house from the field in the rear , took the specimen in the back door and down the cellar stairs , and prepared it for the usual experiment . our fear of the police was absurdly great , though we had timed our trip to avoid the solitary patrolman of that section .\\n\\nthe result was wearily anticlimactic . ghastly as our prize appeared , it was wholly unresponsive to every solution we injected in its black arm ; solutions prepared from experience with white specimens only . so as the hour grew dangerously near to dawn , we did as we had done with the others--dragged the thing across the meadows to the neck of the woods near the potter\\'s field , and buried it there in the best sort of grave the frozen ground would furnish . the grave was not very deep , but fully as good as that of the previous specimen--the thing which had risen of itself and uttered a sound . in the light of our dark lanterns we carefully covered it with leaves and dead vines , fairly certain that the police would never find it in a forest so dim and dense .\\n\\nthe next day i was increasingly apprehensive about the police , for a patient brought rumours of a suspected fight and death . west had still another source of worry , for he had been called in the afternoon to a case which ended very threateningly . an italian woman had become hysterical over her missing child--a lad of five who had strayed off early in the morning and failed to appear for dinner--and had developed symptoms highly alarming in view of an always weak heart . it was a very foolish hysteria , for the boy had often run away before ; but italian peasants are exceedingly superstitious , and this woman seemed as much harassed by omens as by facts . about seven o\\'clock in the evening she had died , and her frantic husband had made a frightful scene in his efforts to kill west , whom he wildly blamed for not saving her life . friends had held him when he drew a stiletto , but west departed amidst his inhuman shrieks , curses and oaths of vengeance . in his latest affliction the fellow seemed to have forgotten his child , who was still missing as the night advanced . there was some talk of searching the woods , but most of the family\\'s friends were busy with the dead woman and the screaming man . altogether , the nervous strain upon west must have been tremendous . thoughts of the police and of the mad italian both weighed heavily .\\n\\nwe retired about eleven , but i did not sleep well . bolton had a surprisingly good police force for so small a town , and i could not help fearing the mess which would ensue if the affair of the night before were ever tracked down . it might mean the end of all our local work--and perhaps prison for both west and me . i did not like those rumours of a fight which were floating about . after the clock had struck three the moon shone in my eyes , but i turned over without rising to pull down the shade . then came the steady rattling at the back door .\\n\\ni lay still and somewhat dazed , but before long heard west\\'s rap on my door . he was clad in dressing-gown and slippers , and had in his hands a revolver and an electric flashlight . from the revolver i knew that he was thinking more of the crazed italian than of the police .\\n\\n\"we\\'d better both go ,\" he whispered . \"it wouldn\\'t do not to answer it anyway , and it may be a patient--it would be like one of those fools to try the back door .\"\\n\\nso we both went down the stairs on tiptoe , with a fear partly justified and partly that which comes only from the soul of the weird small hours . the rattling continued , growing somewhat louder . when we reached the door i cautiously unbolted it and threw it open , and as the moon streamed revealingly down on the form silhouetted there , west did a peculiar thing . despite the obvious danger of attracting notice and bringing down on our heads the dreaded police investigation--a thing which after all was mercifully averted by the relative isolation of our cottage--my friend suddenly , excitedly , and unnecessarily emptied all six chambers of his revolver into the nocturnal visitor .\\n\\nfor that visitor was neither italian nor policeman . looming hideously against the spectral moon was a gigantic misshapen thing not to be imagined save in nightmares--a glassy-eyed , ink-black apparition nearly on all fours , covered with bits of mould , leaves , and vines , foul with caked blood , and having between its glistening teeth a snow--white , terrible , cylindrical object terminating in a tiny hand .\\n\\npart iv : the scream of the dead\\n\\npublished may 1922 in home brew vol . 1 , no . 4 , p . 53-58 .\\n\\nthe scream of a dead man gave to me that acute and added horror of dr . herbert west which harassed the latter years of our companionship . it is natural that such a thing as a dead man\\'s scream should give horror , for it is obviously , not a pleasing or ordinary occurrence ; but i was used to similar experiences , hence suffered on this occasion only because of a particular circumstance . and , as i have implied , it was not of the dead man himself that i became afraid .\\n\\nherbert west , whose associate and assistant i was , possessed scientific interests far beyond the usual routine of a village physician . that was why , when establishing his practice in bolton , he had chosen an isolated house near the potter\\'s field . briefly and brutally stated , west\\'s sole absorbing interest was a secret study of the phenomena of life and its cessation , leading toward the reanimation of the dead through injections of an excitant solution . for this ghastly experimenting it was necessary to have a constant supply of very fresh human bodies ; very fresh because even the least decay hopelessly damaged the brain structure , and human because we found that the solution had to be compounded differently for different types of organisms . scores of rabbits and guinea-pigs had been killed and treated , but their trail was a blind one . west had never fully succeeded because he had never been able to secure a corpse sufficiently fresh . what he wanted were bodies from which vitality had only just departed ; bodies with every cell intact and capable of receiving again the impulse toward that mode of motion called life . there was hope that this second and artificial life might be made perpetual by repetitions of the injection , but we had learned that an ordinary natural life would not respond to the action . to establish the artificial motion , natural life must be extinct--the specimens must be very fresh , but genuinely dead .\\n\\nthe awesome quest had begun when west and i were students at the miskatonic university medical school in arkham , vividly conscious for the first time of the thoroughly mechanical nature of life . that was seven years before , but west looked scarcely a day older now--he was small , blond , clean-shaven , soft-voiced , and spectacled , with only an occasional flash of a cold blue eye to tell of the hardening and growing fanaticism of his character under the pressure of his terrible investigations . our experiences had often been hideous in the extreme ; the results of defective reanimation , when lumps of graveyard clay had been galvanised into morbid , unnatural , and brainless motion by various modifications of the vital solution .\\n\\none thing had uttered a nerve-shattering scream ; another had risen violently , beaten us both to unconsciousness , and run amuck in a shocking way before it could be placed behind asylum bars ; still another , a loathsome african monstrosity , had clawed out of its shallow grave and done a deed--west had had to shoot that object . we could not get bodies fresh enough to shew any trace of reason when reanimated , so had perforce created nameless horrors . it was disturbing to think that one , perhaps two , of our monsters still lived--that thought haunted us shadowingly , till finally west disappeared under frightful circumstances . but at the time of the scream in the cellar laboratory of the isolated bolton cottage , our fears were subordinate to our anxiety for extremely fresh specimens . west was more avid than i , so that it almost seemed to me that he looked half-covetously at any very healthy living physique .\\n\\nit was in july , 1910 , that the bad luck regarding specimens began to turn . i had been on a long visit to my parents in illinois , and upon my return found west in a state of singular elation . he had , he told me excitedly , in all likelihood solved the problem of freshness through an approach from an entirely new angle--that of artificial preservation . i had known that he was working on a new and highly unusual embalming compound , and was not surprised that it had turned out well ; but until he explained the details i was rather puzzled as to how such a compound could help in our work , since the objectionable staleness of the specimens was largely due to delay occurring before we secured them . this , i now saw , west had clearly recognised ; creating his embalming compound for future rather than immediate use , and trusting to fate to supply again some very recent and unburied corpse , as it had years before when we obtained the negro killed in the bolton prize-fight . at last fate had been kind , so that on this occasion there lay in the secret cellar laboratory a corpse whose decay could not by any possibility have begun . what would happen on reanimation , and whether we could hope for a revival of mind and reason , west did not venture to predict . the experiment would be a landmark in our studies , and he had saved the new body for my return , so that both might share the spectacle in accustomed fashion .\\n\\nwest told me how he had obtained the specimen . it had been a vigorous man ; a well-dressed stranger just off the train on his way to transact some business with the bolton worsted mills . the walk through the town had been long , and by the time the traveller paused at our cottage to ask the way to the factories , his heart had become greatly overtaxed . he had refused a stimulant , and had suddenly dropped dead only a moment later . the body , as might be expected , seemed to west a heaven--sent gift . in his brief conversation the stranger had made it clear that he was unknown in bolton , and a search of his pockets subsequently revealed him to be one robert leavitt of st . louis , apparently without a family to make instant inquiries about his disappearance . if this man could not be restored to life , no one would know of our experiment . we buried our materials in a dense strip of woods between the house and the potter\\'s field . if , on the other hand , he could be restored , our fame would be brilliantly and perpetually established . so without delay west had injected into the body\\'s wrist the compound which would hold it fresh for use after my arrival . the matter of the presumably weak heart , which to my mind imperilled the success of our experiment , did not appear to trouble west extensively . he hoped at last to obtain what he had never obtained before--a rekindled spark of reason and perhaps a normal , living creature .\\n\\nso on the night of july 18 , 1910 , herbert west and i stood in the cellar laboratory and gazed at a white , silent figure beneath the dazzling arc-light . the embalming compound had worked uncannily well , for as i stared fascinatedly at the sturdy frame which had lain two weeks without stiffening , i was moved to seek west\\'s assurance that the thing was really dead . this assurance he gave readily enough ; reminding me that the reanimating solution was never used without careful tests as to life , since it could have no effect if any of the original vitality were present . as west proceeded to take preliminary steps , i was impressed by the vast intricacy of the new experiment ; an intricacy so vast that he could trust no hand less delicate than his own . forbidding me to touch the body , he first injected a drug in the wrist just beside the place his needle had punctured when injecting the embalming compound . this , he said , was to neutralise the compound and release the system to a normal relaxation so that the reanimating solution might freely work when injected . slightly later , when a change and a gentle tremor seemed to affect the dead limbs ; west stuffed a pillow-like object violently over the twitching face , not withdrawing it until the corpse appeared quiet and ready for our attempt at reanimation . the pale enthusiast now applied some last perfunctory tests for absolute lifelessness , withdrew satisfied , and finally injected into the left arm an accurately measured amount of the vital elixir , prepared during the afternoon with a greater care than we had used since college days , when our feats were new and groping . i cannot express the wild , breathless suspense with which we waited for results on this first really fresh specimen--the first we could reasonably expect to open its lips in rational speech , perhaps to tell of what it had seen beyond the unfathomable abyss .\\n\\nwest was a materialist , believing in no soul and attributing all the working of consciousness to bodily phenomena ; consequently he looked for no revelation of hideous secrets from gulfs and caverns beyond death\\'s barrier . i did not wholly disagree with him theoretically , yet held vague instinctive remnants of the primitive faith of my forefathers ; so that i could not help eyeing the corpse with a certain amount of awe and terrible expectation . besides--i could not extract from my memory that hideous , inhuman shriek we heard on the night we tried our first experiment in the deserted farmhouse at arkham .\\n\\nvery little time had elapsed before i saw the attempt was not to be a total failure . a touch of colour came to cheeks hitherto chalk-white , and spread out under the curiously ample stubble of sandy beard . west , who had his hand on the pulse of the left wrist , suddenly nodded significantly ; and almost simultaneously a mist appeared on the mirror inclined above the body\\'s mouth . there followed a few spasmodic muscular motions , and then an audible breathing and visible motion of the chest . i looked at the closed eyelids , and thought i detected a quivering . then the lids opened , shewing eyes which were grey , calm , and alive , but still unintelligent and not even curious .\\n\\nin a moment of fantastic whim i whispered questions to the reddening ears ; questions of other worlds of which the memory might still be present . subsequent terror drove them from my mind , but i think the last one , which i repeated , was : \"where have you been ?\" i do not yet know whether i was answered or not , for no sound came from the well--shaped mouth ; but i do know that at that moment i firmly thought the thin lips moved silently , forming syllables which i would have vocalised as \"only now\" if that phrase had possessed any sense or relevancy . at that moment , as i say , i was elated with the conviction that the one great goal had been attained ; and that for the first time a reanimated corpse had uttered distinct words impelled by actual reason . in the next moment there was no doubt about the triumph ; no doubt that the solution had truly accomplished , at least temporarily , its full mission of restoring rational and articulate life to the dead . but in that triumph there came to me the greatest of all horrors--not horror of the thing that spoke , but of the deed that i had witnessed and of the man with whom my professional fortunes were joined .\\n\\nfor that very fresh body , at last writhing into full and terrifying consciousness with eyes dilated at the memory of its last scene on earth , threw out its frantic hands in a life and death struggle with the air , and suddenly collapsing into a second and final dissolution from which there could be no return , screamed out the cry that will ring eternally in my aching brain :\\n\\n\"help ! keep off , you cursed little tow-head fiend--keep that damned needle away from me !\"\\n\\npart v : the horror from the shadows\\n\\npublished june 1922 in home brew vol . 1 , no . 5 , p . 45-50 .\\n\\nmany men have related hideous things , not mentioned in print , which happened on the battlefields of the great war . some of these things have made me faint , others have convulsed me with devastating nausea , while still others have made me tremble and look behind me in the dark ; yet despite the worst of them i believe i can myself relate the most hideous thing of all--the shocking , the unnatural , the unbelievable horror from the shadows .\\n\\nin 1915 i was a physician with the rank of first lieutenant in a canadian regiment in flanders , one of many americans to precede the government itself into the gigantic struggle . i had not entered the army on my own initiative , but rather as a natural result of the enlistment of the man whose indispensable assistant i was--the celebrated boston surgical specialist , dr . herbert west . dr . west had been avid for a chance to serve as surgeon in a great war , and when the chance had come , he carried me with him almost against my will . there were reasons why i could have been glad to let the war separate us ; reasons why i found the practice of medicine and the companionship of west more and more irritating ; but when he had gone to ottawa and through a colleague\\'s influence secured a medical commission as major , i could not resist the imperious persuasion of one determined that i should accompany him in my usual capacity .\\n\\nwhen i say that dr . west was avid to serve in battle , i do not mean to imply that he was either naturally warlike or anxious for the safety of civilisation . always an ice-cold intellectual machine ; slight , blond , blue-eyed , and spectacled ; i think he secretly sneered at my occasional martial enthusiasms and censures of supine neutrality . there was , however , something he wanted in embattled flanders ; and in order to secure it had had to assume a military exterior . what he wanted was not a thing which many persons want , but something connected with the peculiar branch of medical science which he had chosen quite clandestinely to follow , and in which he had achieved amazing and occasionally hideous results . it was , in fact , nothing more or less than an abundant supply of freshly killed men in every stage of dismemberment .\\n\\nherbert west needed fresh bodies because his life-work was the reanimation of the dead . this work was not known to the fashionable clientele who had so swiftly built up his fame after his arrival in boston ; but was only too well known to me , who had been his closest friend and sole assistant since the old days in miskatonic university medical school at arkham . it was in those college days that he had begun his terrible experiments , first on small animals and then on human bodies shockingly obtained . there was a solution which he injected into the veins of dead things , and if they were fresh enough they responded in strange ways . he had had much trouble in discovering the proper formula , for each type of organism was found to need a stimulus especially adapted to it . terror stalked him when he reflected on his partial failures ; nameless things resulting from imperfect solutions or from bodies insufficiently fresh . a certain number of these failures had remained alive--one was in an asylum while others had vanished--and as he thought of conceivable yet virtually impossible eventualities he often shivered beneath his usual stolidity .\\n\\nwest had soon learned that absolute freshness was the prime requisite for useful specimens , and had accordingly resorted to frightful and unnatural expedients in body-snatching . in college , and during our early practice together in the factory town of bolton , my attitude toward him had been largely one of fascinated admiration ; but as his boldness in methods grew , i began to develop a gnawing fear . i did not like the way he looked at healthy living bodies ; and then there came a nightmarish session in the cellar laboratory when i learned that a certain specimen had been a living body when he secured it . that was the first time he had ever been able to revive the quality of rational thought in a corpse ; and his success , obtained at such a loathsome cost , had completely hardened him .\\n\\nof his methods in the intervening five years i dare not speak . i was held to him by sheer force of fear , and witnessed sights that no human tongue could repeat . gradually i came to find herbert west himself more horrible than anything he did--that was when it dawned on me that his once normal scientific zeal for prolonging life had subtly degenerated into a mere morbid and ghoulish curiosity and secret sense of charnel picturesqueness . his interest became a hellish and perverse addiction to the repellently and fiendishly abnormal ; he gloated calmly over artificial monstrosities which would make most healthy men drop dead from fright and disgust ; he became , behind his pallid intellectuality , a fastidious baudelaire of physical experiment--a languid elagabalus of the tombs .\\n\\ndangers he met unflinchingly ; crimes he committed unmoved . i think the climax came when he had proved his point that rational life can be restored , and had sought new worlds to conquer by experimenting on the reanimation of detached parts of bodies . he had wild and original ideas on the independent vital properties of organic cells and nerve-tissue separated from natural physiological systems ; and achieved some hideous preliminary results in the form of never-dying , artificially nourished tissue obtained from the nearly hatched eggs of an indescribable tropical reptile . two biological points he was exceedingly anxious to settle--first , whether any amount of consciousness and rational action be possible without the brain , proceeding from the spinal cord and various nerve-centres ; and second , whether any kind of ethereal , intangible relation distinct from the material cells may exist to link the surgically separated parts of what has previously been a single living organism . all this research work required a prodigious supply of freshly slaughtered human flesh--and that was why herbert west had entered the great war .\\n\\nthe phantasmal , unmentionable thing occurred one midnight late in march , 1915 , in a field hospital behind the lines of st . eloi . i wonder even now if it could have been other than a daemoniac dream of delirium . west had a private laboratory in an east room of the barn-like temporary edifice , assigned him on his plea that he was devising new and radical methods for the treatment of hitherto hopeless cases of maiming . there he worked like a butcher in the midst of his gory wares--i could never get used to the levity with which he handled and classified certain things . at times he actually did perform marvels of surgery for the soldiers ; but his chief delights were of a less public and philanthropic kind , requiring many explanations of sounds which seemed peculiar even amidst that babel of the damned . among these sounds were frequent revolver-shots--surely not uncommon on a battlefield , but distinctly uncommon in an hospital . dr . west\\'s reanimated specimens were not meant for long existence or a large audience . besides human tissue , west employed much of the reptile embryo tissue which he had cultivated with such singular results . it was better than human material for maintaining life in organless fragments , and that was now my friend\\'s chief activity . in a dark corner of the laboratory , over a queer incubating burner , he kept a large covered vat full of this reptilian cell-matter ; which multiplied and grew puffily and hideously .\\n\\non the night of which i speak we had a splendid new specimen--a man at once physically powerful and of such high mentality that a sensitive nervous system was assured . it was rather ironic , for he was the officer who had helped west to his commission , and who was now to have been our associate . moreover , he had in the past secretly studied the theory of reanimation to some extent under west . major sir eric moreland clapham-lee , d .s .o . , was the greatest surgeon in our division , and had been hastily assigned to the st . eloi sector when news of the heavy fighting reached headquarters . he had come in an aeroplane piloted by the intrepid lieut . ronald hill , only to be shot down when directly over his destination . the fall had been spectacular and awful ; hill was unrecognisable afterward , but the wreck yielded up the great surgeon in a nearly decapitated but otherwise intact condition . west had greedily seized the lifeless thing which had once been his friend and fellow-scholar ; and i shuddered when he finished severing the head , placed it in his hellish vat of pulpy reptile--tissue to preserve it for future experiments , and proceeded to treat the decapitated body on the operating table . he injected new blood , joined certain veins , arteries , and nerves at the headless neck , and closed the ghastly aperture with engrafted skin from an unidentified specimen which had borne an officer\\'s uniform . i knew what he wanted--to see if this highly organised body could exhibit , without its head , any of the signs of mental life which had distinguished sir eric moreland clapham-lee . once a student of reanimation , this silent trunk was now gruesomely called upon to exemplify it .\\n\\ni can still see herbert west under the sinister electric light as he injected his reanimating solution into the arm of the headless body . the scene i cannot describe--i should faint if i tried it , for there is madness in a room full of classified charnel things , with blood and lesser human debris almost ankle-deep on the slimy floor , and with hideous reptilian abnormalities sprouting , bubbling , and baking over a winking bluish-green spectre of dim flame in a far corner of black shadows .\\n\\nthe specimen , as west repeatedly observed , had a splendid nervous system . much was expected of it ; and as a few twitching motions began to appear , i could see the feverish interest on west\\'s face . he was ready , i think , to see proof of his increasingly strong opinion that consciousness , reason , and personality can exist independently of the brain--that man has no central connective spirit , but is merely a machine of nervous matter , each section more or less complete in itself . in one triumphant demonstration west was about to relegate the mystery of life to the category of myth . the body now twitched more vigorously , and beneath our avid eyes commenced to heave in a frightful way . the arms stirred disquietingly , the legs drew up , and various muscles contracted in a repulsive kind of writhing . then the headless thing threw out its arms in a gesture which was unmistakably one of desperation--an intelligent desperation apparently sufficient to prove every theory of herbert west . certainly , the nerves were recalling the man\\'s last act in life ; the struggle to get free of the falling aeroplane .\\n\\nwhat followed , i shall never positively know . it may have been wholly an hallucination from the shock caused at that instant by the sudden and complete destruction of the building in a cataclysm of german shell-fire--who can gainsay it , since west and i were the only proved survivors ? west liked to think that before his recent disappearance , but there were times when he could not ; for it was queer that we both had the same hallucination . the hideous occurrence itself was very simple , notable only for what it implied .\\n\\nthe body on the table had risen with a blind and terrible groping , and we had heard a sound . i should not call that sound a voice , for it was too awful . and yet its timbre was not the most awful thing about it . neither was its message--it had merely screamed , \"jump , ronald , for god\\'s sake , jump !\" the awful thing was its source .\\n\\nfor it had come from the large covered vat in that ghoulish corner of crawling black shadows .\\n\\npart vi : the tomb-legions\\n\\npublished july 1922 in home brew vol . 1 , no . 6 , p . 57-62 .>\\n\\nwhen dr . herbert west disappeared a year ago , the boston police questioned me closely . they suspected that i was holding something back , and perhaps suspected graver things ; but i could not tell them the truth because they would not have believed it . they knew , indeed , that west had been connected with activities beyond the credence of ordinary men ; for his hideous experiments in the reanimation of dead bodies had long been too extensive to admit of perfect secrecy ; but the final soul-shattering catastrophe held elements of daemoniac phantasy which make even me doubt the reality of what i saw .\\n\\ni was west\\'s closest friend and only confidential assistant . we had met years before , in medical school , and from the first i had shared his terrible researches . he had slowly tried to perfect a solution which , injected into the veins of the newly deceased , would restore life ; a labour demanding an abundance of fresh corpses and therefore involving the most unnatural actions . still more shocking were the products of some of the experiments--grisly masses of flesh that had been dead , but that west waked to a blind , brainless , nauseous animation . these were the usual results , for in order to reawaken the mind it was necessary to have specimens so absolutely fresh that no decay could possibly affect the delicate brain-cells .\\n\\nthis need for very fresh corpses had been west\\'s moral undoing . they were hard to get , and one awful day he had secured his specimen while it was still alive and vigorous . a struggle , a needle , and a powerful alkaloid had transformed it to a very fresh corpse , and the experiment had succeeded for a brief and memorable moment ; but west had emerged with a soul calloused and seared , and a hardened eye which sometimes glanced with a kind of hideous and calculating appraisal at men of especially sensitive brain and especially vigorous physique . toward the last i became acutely afraid of west , for he began to look at me that way . people did not seem to notice his glances , but they noticed my fear ; and after his disappearance used that as a basis for some absurd suspicions .\\n\\nwest , in reality , was more afraid than i ; for his abominable pursuits entailed a life of furtiveness and dread of every shadow . partly it was the police he feared ; but sometimes his nervousness was deeper and more nebulous , touching on certain indescribable things into which he had injected a morbid life , and from which he had not seen that life depart . he usually finished his experiments with a revolver , but a few times he had not been quick enough . there was that first specimen on whose rifled grave marks of clawing were later seen . there was also that arkham professor\\'s body which had done cannibal things before it had been captured and thrust unidentified into a madhouse cell at sefton , where it beat the walls for sixteen years . most of the other possibly surviving results were things less easy to speak of--for in later years west\\'s scientific zeal had degenerated to an unhealthy and fantastic mania , and he had spent his chief skill in vitalising not entire human bodies but isolated parts of bodies , or parts joined to organic matter other than human . it had become fiendishly disgusting by the time he disappeared ; many of the experiments could not even be hinted at in print . the great war , through which both of us served as surgeons , had intensified this side of west .\\n\\nin saying that west\\'s fear of his specimens was nebulous , i have in mind particularly its complex nature . part of it came merely from knowing of the existence of such nameless monsters , while another part arose from apprehension of the bodily harm they might under certain circumstances do him . their disappearance added horror to the situation--of them all , west knew the whereabouts of only one , the pitiful asylum thing . then there was a more subtle fear--a very fantastic sensation resulting from a curious experiment in the canadian army in 1915 . west , in the midst of a severe battle , had reanimated major sir eric moreland clapham-lee , d .s .o . , a fellow-physician who knew about his experiments and could have duplicated them . the head had been removed , so that the possibilities of quasi-intelligent life in the trunk might be investigated . just as the building was wiped out by a german shell , there had been a success . the trunk had moved intelligently ; and , unbelievable to relate , we were both sickeningly sure that articulate sounds had come from the detached head as it lay in a shadowy corner of the laboratory . the shell had been merciful , in a way--but west could never feel as certain as he wished , that we two were the only survivors . he used to make shuddering conjectures about the possible actions of a headless physician with the power of reanimating the dead .\\n\\nwest\\'s last quarters were in a venerable house of much elegance , overlooking one of the oldest burying-grounds in boston . he had chosen the place for purely symbolic and fantastically aesthetic reasons , since most of the interments were of the colonial period and therefore of little use to a scientist seeking very fresh bodies . the laboratory was in a sub-cellar secretly constructed by imported workmen , and contained a huge incinerator for the quiet and complete disposal of such bodies , or fragments and synthetic mockeries of bodies , as might remain from the morbid experiments and unhallowed amusements of the owner . during the excavation of this cellar the workmen had struck some exceedingly ancient masonry ; undoubtedly connected with the old burying-ground , yet far too deep to correspond with any known sepulchre therein . after a number of calculations west decided that it represented some secret chamber beneath the tomb of the averills , where the last interment had been made in 1768 . i was with him when he studied the nitrous , dripping walls laid bare by the spades and mattocks of the men , and was prepared for the gruesome thrill which would attend the uncovering of centuried grave-secrets ; but for the first time west\\'s new timidity conquered his natural curiosity , and he betrayed his degenerating fibre by ordering the masonry left intact and plastered over . thus it remained till that final hellish night ; part of the walls of the secret laboratory . i speak of west\\'s decadence , but must add that it was a purely mental and intangible thing . outwardly he was the same to the last--calm , cold , slight , and yellow-haired , with spectacled blue eyes and a general aspect of youth which years and fears seemed never to change . he seemed calm even when he thought of that clawed grave and looked over his shoulder ; even when he thought of the carnivorous thing that gnawed and pawed at sefton bars .\\n\\nthe end of herbert west began one evening in our joint study when he was dividing his curious glance between the newspaper and me . a strange headline item had struck at him from the crumpled pages , and a nameless titan claw had seemed to reach down through sixteen years . something fearsome and incredible had happened at sefton asylum fifty miles away , stunning the neighbourhood and baffling the police . in the small hours of the morning a body of silent men had entered the grounds , and their leader had aroused the attendants . he was a menacing military figure who talked without moving his lips and whose voice seemed almost ventriloquially connected with an immense black case he carried . his expressionless face was handsome to the point of radiant beauty , but had shocked the superintendent when the hall light fell on it--for it was a wax face with eyes of painted glass . some nameless accident had befallen this man . a larger man guided his steps ; a repellent hulk whose bluish face seemed half eaten away by some unknown malady . the speaker had asked for the custody of the cannibal monster committed from arkham sixteen years before ; and upon being refused , gave a signal which precipitated a shocking riot . the fiends had beaten , trampled , and bitten every attendant who did not flee ; killing four and finally succeeding in the liberation of the monster . those victims who could recall the event without hysteria swore that the creatures had acted less like men than like unthinkable automata guided by the wax-faced leader . by the time help could be summoned , every trace of the men and of their mad charge had vanished .\\n\\nfrom the hour of reading this item until midnight , west sat almost paralysed . at midnight the doorbell rang , startling him fearfully . all the servants were asleep in the attic , so i answered the bell . as i have told the police , there was no wagon in the street , but only a group of strange-looking figures bearing a large square box which they deposited in the hallway after one of them had grunted in a highly unnatural voice , \"express--prepaid .\"they filed out of the house with a jerky tread , and as i watched them go i had an odd idea that they were turning toward the ancient cemetery on which the back of the house abutted . when i slammed the door after them west came downstairs and looked at the box . it was about two feet square , and bore west\\'s correct name and present address . it also bore the inscription , \"from eric moreland clapham-lee , st . eloi , flanders .\"six years before , in flanders , a shelled hospital had fallen upon the headless reanimated trunk of dr . clapham-lee , and upon the detached head which--perhaps--had uttered articulate sounds .\\n\\nwest was not even excited now . his condition was more ghastly . quickly he said , \"it\\'s the finish--but let\\'s incinerate--this .\"we carried the thing down to the laboratory--listening . i do not remember many particulars--you can imagine my state of mind--but it is a vicious lie to say it was herbert west\\'s body which i put into the incinerator . we both inserted the whole unopened wooden box , closed the door , and started the electricity . nor did any sound come from the box , after all .\\n\\nit was west who first noticed the falling plaster on that part of the wall where the ancient tomb masonry had been covered up . i was going to run , but he stopped me . then i saw a small black aperture , felt a ghoulish wind of ice , and smelled the charnel bowels of a putrescent earth . there was no sound , but just then the electric lights went out and i saw outlined against some phosphorescence of the nether world a horde of silent toiling things which only insanity--or worse--could create . their outlines were human , semi-human , fractionally human , and not human at all--the horde was grotesquely heterogeneous . they were removing the stones quietly , one by one , from the centuried wall . and then , as the breach became large enough , they came out into the laboratory in single file ; led by a talking thing with a beautiful head made of wax . a sort of mad-eyed monstrosity behind the leader seized on herbert west . west did not resist or utter a sound . then they all sprang at him and tore him to pieces before my eyes , bearing the fragments away into that subterranean vault of fabulous abominations . west\\'s head was carried off by the wax-headed leader , who wore a canadian officer\\'s uniform . as it disappeared i saw that the blue eyes behind the spectacles were hideously blazing with their first touch of frantic , visible emotion .\\n\\nservants found me unconscious in the morning . west was gone . the incinerator contained only unidentifiable ashes . detectives have questioned me , but what can i say ? the sefton tragedy they will not connect with west ; not that , nor the men with the box , whose existence they deny . i told them of the vault , and they pointed to the unbroken plaster wall and laughed . so i told them no more . they imply that i am either a madman or a murderer--probably i am mad . but i might not be mad if those accursed tomb-legions had not been so silent .\\n', shape=(), dtype=string)\n",
            "tf.Tensor(b'the unnamable\\n\\nwith this friend , joel manton , i had often languidly disputed . he was principal of the east high school , born and bred in boston and sharing new england\\'s self-satisfied deafness to the delicate overtones of life . it was his view that only our normal , objective experiences possess any esthetic significance , and that it is the province of the artist not so much to rouse strong emotion by action , ecstasy , and astonishment , as to maintain a placid interest and appreciation by accurate , detailed transcripts of everyday affairs . especially did he object to my preoccupation with the mystical and the unexplained ; for although believing in the supernatural much more fully than i , he would not admit that it is sufficiently commonplace for literary treatment . that a mind can find its greatest pleasure in escapes from the daily treadmill , and in original and dramatic recombinations of images usually thrown by habit and fatigue into the hackneyed patterns of actual existence , was something virtually incredible to his clear , practical , and logical intellect . with him all things and feelings had fixed dimensions , properties , causes , and effects ; and although he vaguely knew that the mind sometimes holds visions and sensations of far less geometrical , classifiable , and workable nature , he believed himself justified in drawing an arbitrary line and ruling out of court all that cannot be experienced and understood by the average citizen . besides , he was almost sure that nothing can be really \"unnamable .\" it didn\\'t sound sensible to him .\\n\\nthough i well realized the futility of imaginative and metaphysical arguments against the complacency of an orthodox sun-dweller , something in the scene of this afternoon colloquy moved me to more than usual contentiousness . the crumbling slate slabs , the patriarchal trees , and the centuried gambrel roofs of the witch-haunted old town that stretched around , all combined to rouse my spirit in defense of my work ; and i was soon carrying my thrusts into the enemy\\'s own country . it was not , indeed , difficult to begin a counter-attack , for i knew that joel manton actually half clung to many old-wives\\' superstitions which sophisticated people had long outgrown ; beliefs in the appearance of dying persons at distant places , and in the impressions left by old faces on the windows through which they had gazed all their lives . to credit these whisperings of rural grandmothers , i now insisted , argued a faith in the existence of spectral substances on the earth apart from and subsequent to their material counterparts . it argued a capability of believing in phenomena beyond all normal notions ; for if a dead man can transmit his visible or tangible image half across the world , or down the stretch of the centuries , how can it be absurd to suppose that deserted houses are full of queer sentient things , or that old graveyards teem with the terrible , unbodied intelligence of generations ? and since spirit , in order to cause all the manifestations attributed to it , cannot be limited by any of the laws of matter , why is it extravagant to imagine psychically living dead things in shapes--or absences of shapes--which must for human spectators be utterly and appallingly \"unnamable\" ? \"common sense\" in reflecting on these subjects , i assured my friend with some warmth , is merely a stupid absence of imagination and mental flexibility .\\n\\ntwilight had now approached , but neither of us felt any wish to cease speaking . manton seemed unimpressed by my arguments , and eager to refute them , having that confidence in his own opinions which had doubtless caused his success as a teacher ; whilst i was too sure of my ground to fear defeat . the dusk fell , and lights faintly gleamed in some of the distant windows , but we did not move . our seat on the tomb was very comfortable , and i knew that my prosaic friend would not mind the cavernous rift in the ancient , root-disturbed brickwork close behind us , or the utter blackness of the spot brought by the intervention of a tottering , deserted seventeenth-century house between us and the nearest lighted road . there in the dark , upon that riven tomb by the deserted house , we talked on about the \"unnamable\" and after my friend had finished his scoffing i told him of the awful evidence behind the story at which he had scoffed the most .\\n\\nmy tale had been called the attic window , and appeared in the january , 1922 , issue of whispers . in a good many places , especially the south and the pacific coast , they took the magazines off the stands at the complaints of silly milk-sops ; but new england didn\\'t get the thrill and merely shrugged its shoulders at my extravagance . the thing , it was averred , was biologically impossible to start with ; merely another of those crazy country mutterings which cotton mather had been gullible enough to dump into his chaotic magnalia christi americana , and so poorly authenticated that even he had not ventured to name the locality where the horror occurred . and as to the way i amplified the bare jotting of the old mystic--that was quite impossible , and characteristic of a flighty and notional scribbler ! mather had indeed told of the thing as being born , but nobody but a cheap sensationalist would think of having it grow up , look into people\\'s windows at night , and be hidden in the attic of a house , in flesh and in spirit , till someone saw it at the window centuries later and couldn\\'t describe what it was that turned his hair gray . all this was flagrant trashiness , and my friend manton was not slow to insist on that fact . then i told him what i had found in an old diary kept between 1706 and 1723 , unearthed among family papers not a mile from where we were sitting ; that , and the certain reality of the scars on my ancestor\\'s chest and back which the diary described . i told him , too , of the fears of others in that region , and how they were whispered down for generations ; and how no mythical madness came to the boy who in 1793 entered an abandoned house to examine certain traces suspected to be there .\\n\\nit had been an eldritch thing--no wonder sensitive students shudder at the puritan age in massachusetts . so little is known of what went on beneath the surface--so little , yet such a ghastly festering as it bubbles up putrescently in occasional ghoulish glimpses . the witchcraft terror is a horrible ray of light on what was stewing in men\\'s crushed brains , but even that is a trifle . there was no beauty ; no freedom--we can see that from the architectural and household remains , and the poisonous sermons of the cramped divines . and inside that rusted iron straitjacket lurked gibbering hideousness , perversion , and diabolism . here , truly , was the apotheosis of the unnamable .\\n\\ncotton mather , in that demoniac sixth book which no one should read after dark , minced no words as he flung forth his anathema . stern as a jewish prophet , and laconically un-amazed as none since his day could be , he told of the beast that had brought forth what was more than beast but less than man--the thing with the blemished eye--and of the screaming drunken wretch that hanged for having such an eye . this much he baldly told , yet without a hint of what came after . perhaps he did not know , or perhaps he knew and did not dare to tell . others knew , but did not dare to tell--there is no public hint of why they whispered about the lock on the door to the attic stairs in the house of a childless , broken , embittered old man who had put up a blank slate slab by an avoided grave , although one may trace enough evasive legends to curdle the thinnest blood .\\n\\nit is all in that ancestral diary i found ; all the hushed innuendoes and furtive tales of things with a blemished eye seen at windows in the night or in deserted meadows near the woods . something had caught my ancestor on a dark valley road , leaving him with marks of horns on his chest and of apelike claws on his back ; and when they looked for prints in the trampled dust they found the mixed marks of split hooves and vaguely anthropoid paws . once a post-rider said he saw an old man chasing and calling to a frightful loping , nameless thing on meadow hill in the thinly moonlit hours before dawn , and many believed him . certainly , there was strange talk one night in 1710 when the childless , broken old man was buried in the crypt behind his own house in sight of the blank slate slab . they never unlocked that attic door , but left the whole house as it was , dreaded and deserted . when noises came from it , they whispered and shivered ; and hoped that the lock on that attic door was strong . then they stopped hoping when the horror occurred at the parsonage , leaving not a soul alive or in one piece . with the years the legends take on a spectral character--i suppose the thing , if it was a living thing , must have died . the memory had lingered hideously--all the more hideous because it was so secret .\\n\\nduring this narration my friend manton had become very silent , and i saw that my words had impressed him . he did not laugh as i paused , but asked quite seriously about the boy who went mad in 1793 , and who had presumably been the hero of my fiction . i told him why the boy had gone to that shunned , deserted house , and remarked that he ought to be interested , since he believed that windows retained latent images of those who had sat at them . the boy had gone to look at the windows of that horrible attic , because of tales of things seen behind them , and had come back screaming maniacally .\\n\\nmanton remained thoughtful as i said this , but gradually reverted to his analytical mood . he granted for the sake of argument that some unnatural monster had really existed , but reminded me that even the most morbid perversion of nature need not be unnamable or scientifically indescribable . i admired his clearness and persistence , and added some further revelations i had collected among the old people . those later spectral legends , i made plain , related to monstrous apparitions more frightful than anything organic could be ; apparitions of gigantic bestial forms sometimes visible and sometimes only tangible , which floated about on moonless nights and haunted the old house , the crypt behind it , and the grave where a sapling had sprouted beside an illegible slab . whether or not such apparitions had ever gored or smothered people to death , as told in uncorroborated traditions , they had produced a strong and consistent impression ; and were yet darkly feared by very aged natives , though largely forgotten by the last two generations--perhaps dying for lack of being thought about . moreover , so far as esthetic theory was involved , if the psychic emanations of human creatures be grotesque distortions , what coherent representation could express or portray so gibbous and infamous a nebulosity as the specter of a malign , chaotic perversion , itself a morbid blasphemy against nature ? molded by the dead brain of a hybrid nightmare , would not such a vaporous terror constitute in all loathsome truth the exquisitely , the shriekingly unnamable ?\\n\\nthe hour must now have grown very late . a singularly noiseless bat brushed by me , and i believe it touched manton also , for although i could not see him i felt him raise his arm . presently he spoke .\\n\\n\"but is that house with the attic window still standing and deserted ?\"\\n\\n\"yes ,\" i answered , \"i have seen it .\"\\n\\n\"and did you find anything there--in the attic or anywhere else ?\"\\n\\n\"there were some bones up under the eaves . they may have been what that boy saw--if he was sensitive he wouldn\\'t have needed anything in the window-glass to unhinge him . if they all came from the same object it must have been an hysterical , delirious monstrosity . it would have been blasphemous to leave such bones in the world , so i went back with a sack and took them to the tomb behind the house . there was an opening where i could dump them in . don\\'t think i was a fool--you ought to have seen that skull . it had four-inch horns , but a face and jaw something like yours and mine .\"\\n\\nat last i could feel a real shiver run through manton , who had moved very near . but his curiosity was undeterred .\\n\\n\"and what about the window-panes ?\"\\n\\n\"they were all gone . one window had lost its entire frame , and in all the others there was not a trace of glass in the little diamond apertures . they were that kind--the old lattice windows that went out of use before 1700 . i don\\'t believe they\\'ve had any glass for a hundred years or more--maybe the boy broke \\'em if he got that far ; the legend doesn\\'t say .\"\\n\\nmanton was reflecting again .\\n\\n\"i\\'d like to see that house , carter . where is it ? glass or no glass , i must explore it a little . and the tomb where you put those bones , and the other grave without an inscription--the whole thing must be a bit terrible .\"\\n\\n\"you did see it--until it got dark .\"\\n\\nmy friend was more wrought upon than i had suspected , for at this touch of harmless theatricalism he started neurotically away from me and actually cried out with a sort of gulping gasp which released a strain of previous repression . it was an odd cry , and all the more terrible because it was answered . for as it was still echoing , i heard a creaking sound through the pitchy blackness , and knew that a lattice window was opening in that accursed old house beside us . and because all the other frames were long since fallen , i knew that it was the grisly glassless frame of that demoniac attic window .\\n\\nthen came a noxious rush of noisome , frigid air from that same dreaded direction , followed by a piercing shriek just beside me on that shocking rifted tomb of man and monster . in another instant i was knocked from my gruesome bench by the devilish threshing of some unseen entity of titanic size but undetermined nature ; knocked sprawling on the root-clutched mold of that abhorrent graveyard , while from the tomb came such a stifled uproar of gasping and whirring that my fancy peopled the rayless gloom with miltonic legions of the misshapen damned . there was a vortex of withering , ice-cold wind , and then the rattle of loose bricks and plaster ; but i had mercifully fainted before i could learn what it meant .\\n\\nmanton , though smaller than i , is more resilient ; for we opened our eyes at almost the same instant , despite his greater injuries . our couches were side by side , and we knew in a few seconds that we were in st . mary\\'s hospital . attendants were grouped about in tense curiosity , eager to aid our memory by telling us how we came there , and we soon heard of the farmer who had found us at noon in a lonely field beyond meadow hill , a mile from the old burying ground , on a spot where an ancient slaughterhouse is reputed to have stood . manton had two malignant wounds in the chest , and some less severe cuts or gougings in the back . i was not so seriously hurt , but was covered with welts and contusions of the most bewildering character , including the print of a split hoof . it was plain that manton knew more than i , but he told nothing to the puzzled and interested physicians till he had learned what our injuries were . then he said we were the victims of a vicious bull--though the animal was a difficult thing to place and account for .\\n\\nafter the doctors and nurses had left , i whispered an awe struck question :\\n\\n\"good god , manton , but what was it ? those scars--was it like that ?\"\\n\\nand i was too dazed to exult when he whispered back a thing i had half expected--\\n\\n\"no--it wasn\\'t that way at all . it was everywhere--a gelatin--a slime yet it had shapes , a thousand shapes of horror beyond all memory . there were eyes--and a blemish . it was the pit--the maelstrom--the ultimate abomination . carter , it was the unnamable !\\n', shape=(), dtype=string)\n",
            "tf.Tensor(b'nyarlathotep\\n\\nnyarlathotep . . .the crawling chaos . . .i am the last . . .i will tell the audient void . . . .\\n\\ni do not recall distinctly when it began , but it was months ago . the general tension was horrible . to a season of political and social upheaval was added a strange and brooding apprehension of hideous physical danger ; a danger widespread and all-embracing , such a danger as may be imagined only in the most terrible phantasms of the night . i recall that the people went about with pale and worried faces , and whispered warnings and prophecies which no one dared consciously repeat or acknowledge to himself that he had heard . a sense of monstrous guilt was upon the land , and out of the abysses between the stars swept chill currents that made men shiver in dark and lonely places . there was a daemoniac alteration in the sequence of the seasons--the autumn heat lingered fearsomely , and everyone felt that the world and perhaps the universe had passed from the control of known gods or forces to that of gods or forces which were unknown .\\n\\nand it was then that nyarlathotep came out of egypt . who he was , none could tell , but he was of the old native blood and looked like a pharaoh . the fellahin knelt when they saw him , yet could not say why . he said he had risen up out of the blackness of twenty-seven centuries , and that he had heard messages from places not on this planet . into the lands of civilisation came nyarlathotep , swarthy , slender , and sinister , always buying strange instruments of glass and metal and combining them into instruments yet stranger . he spoke much of the sciences--of electricity and psychology--and gave exhibitions of power which sent his spectators away speechless , yet which swelled his fame to exceeding magnitude . men advised one another to see nyarlathotep , and shuddered . and where nyarlathotep went , rest vanished ; for the small hours were rent with the screams of nightmare . never before had the screams of nightmare been such a public problem ; now the wise men almost wished they could forbid sleep in the small hours , that the shrieks of cities might less horribly disturb the pale , pitying moon as it glimmered on green waters gliding under bridges , and old steeples crumbling against a sickly sky .\\n\\ni remember when nyarlathotep came to my city--the great , the old , the terrible city of unnumbered crimes . my friend had told me of him , and of the impelling fascination and allurement of his revelations , and i burned with eagerness to explore his uttermost mysteries . my friend said they were horrible and impressive beyond my most fevered imaginings ; and what was thrown on a screen in the darkened room prophesied things none but nyarlathotep dared prophesy , and in the sputter of his sparks there was taken from men that which had never been taken before yet which shewed only in the eyes . and i heard it hinted abroad that those who knew nyarlathotep looked on sights which others saw not .\\n\\nit was in the hot autumn that i went through the night with the restless crowds to see nyarlathotep ; through the stifling night and up the endless stairs into the choking room . and shadowed on a screen , i saw hooded forms amidst ruins , and yellow evil faces peering from behind fallen monuments . and i saw the world battling against blackness ; against the waves of destruction from ultimate space ; whirling , churning , struggling around the dimming , cooling sun . then the sparks played amazingly around the heads of the spectators , and hair stood up on end whilst shadows more grotesque than i can tell came out and squatted on the heads . and when i , who was colder and more scientific than the rest , mumbled a trembling protest about \"imposture\" and \"static electricity ,\" nyarlathotep drove us all out , down the dizzy stairs into the damp , hot , deserted midnight streets . i screamed aloud that i was not afraid ; that i never could be afraid ; and others screamed with me for solace . we swore to one another that the city was exactly the same , and still alive ; and when the electric lights began to fade we cursed the company over and over again , and laughed at the queer faces we made .\\n\\ni believe we felt something coming down from the greenish moon , for when we began to depend on its light we drifted into curious involuntary marching formations and seemed to know our destinations though we dared not think of them . once we looked at the pavement and found the blocks loose and displaced by grass , with scarce a line of rusted metal to shew where the tramways had run . and again we saw a tram-car , lone , windowless , dilapidated , and almost on its side . when we gazed around the horizon , we could not find the third tower by the river , and noticed that the silhouette of the second tower was ragged at the top . then we split up into narrow columns , each of which seemed drawn in a different direction . one disappeared in a narrow alley to the left , leaving only the echo of a shocking moan . another filed down a weed-choked subway entrance , howling with a laughter that was mad . my own column was sucked toward the open country , and presently i felt a chill which was not of the hot autumn ; for as we stalked out on the dark moor , we beheld around us the hellish moon-glitter of evil snows . trackless , inexplicable snows , swept asunder in one direction only , where lay a gulf all the blacker for its glittering walls . the column seemed very thin indeed as it plodded dreamily into the gulf . i lingered behind , for the black rift in the green-litten snow was frightful , and i thought i had heard the reverberations of a disquieting wail as my companions vanished ; but my power to linger was slight . as if beckoned by those who had gone before , i half-floated between the titanic snowdrifts , quivering and afraid , into the sightless vortex of the unimaginable .\\n\\nscreamingly sentient , dumbly delirious , only the gods that were can tell . a sickened , sensitive shadow writhing in hands that are not hands , and whirled blindly past ghastly midnights of rotting creation , corpses of dead worlds with sores that were cities , charnel winds that brush the pallid stars and make them flicker low . beyond the worlds vague ghosts of monstrous things ; half-seen columns of unsanctifled temples that rest on nameless rocks beneath space and reach up to dizzy vacua above the spheres of light and darkness . and through this revolting graveyard of the universe the muffled , maddening beating of drums , and thin , monotonous whine of blasphemous flutes from inconceivable , unlighted chambers beyond time ; the detestable pounding and piping whereunto dance slowly , awkwardly , and absurdly the gigantic , tenebrous ultimate gods--the blind , voiceless , mindless gargoyles whose soul is nyarlathotep .\\n', shape=(), dtype=string)\n",
            "tf.Tensor(b'the case of charles dexter ward\\n\\nthe essential saltes of animals may be so prepared and preserved , that an ingenious man may have the whole ark of noah in his own studie , and raise the fine shape of an animal out of its ashes at his pleasure ; and by the lyke method from the essential saltes of humane dust , a philosopher may , without any criminal necromancy , call up the shape of any dead ancestour from the dust whereinto his bodie has been incinerated .\\n\\n--borellus\\n\\ncontents i . a result and a prologue ii . an antecedent and a horror iii . a search and an evocation iv . a mutation and a madness v . a nightmare and a cataclysm\\n\\ni . a result and a prologue\\n\\n1\\n\\nfrom a private hospital for the insane near providence , rhode island , there recently disappeared an exceedingly singular person . he bore the name of charles dexter ward , and was placed under restraint most reluctantly by the grieving father who had watched his aberration grow from a mere eccentricity to a dark mania involving both a possibility of murderous tendencies and a profound and peculiar change in the apparent contents of his mind . doctors confess themselves quite baffled by his case , since it presented oddities of a general physiological as well as psychological character .\\n\\nin the first place , the patient seemed oddly older than his twenty-six years would warrant . mental disturbance , it is true , will age one rapidly ; but the face of this young man had taken on a subtle cast which only the very aged normally acquire . in the second place , his organic processes shewed a certain queerness of proportion which nothing in medical experience can parallel . respiration and heart action had a baffling lack of symmetry ; the voice was lost , so that no sounds above a whisper were possible ; digestion was incredibly prolonged and minimised , and neural reactions to standard stimuli bore no relation at all to anything heretofore recorded , either normal or pathological . the skin had a morbid chill and dryness , and the cellular structure of the tissue seemed exaggeratedly coarse and loosely knit . even a large olive birthmark on the right hip had disappeared , whilst there had formed on the chest a very peculiar mole or blackish spot of which no trace existed before . in general , all physicians agree that in ward the processes of metabolism had become retarded to a degree beyond precedent .\\n\\npsychologically , too , charles ward was unique . his madness held no affinity to any sort recorded in even the latest and most exhaustive of treatises , and was conjoined to a mental force which would have made him a genius or a leader had it not been twisted into strange and grotesque forms . dr . willett , who was ward\\'s family physician , affirms that the patient\\'s gross mental capacity , as gauged by his response to matters outside the sphere of his insanity , had actually increased since the seizure . ward , it is true , was always a scholar and an antiquarian ; but even his most brilliant early work did not shew the prodigious grasp and insight displayed during his last examinations by the alienists . it was , indeed , a difficult matter to obtain a legal commitment to the hospital , so powerful and lucid did the youth\\'s mind seem ; and only on the evidence of others , and on the strength of many abnormal gaps in his stock of information as distinguished from his intelligence , was he finally placed in confinement . to the very moment of his vanishment he was an omnivorous reader and as great a conversationalist as his poor voice permitted ; and shrewd observers , failing to foresee his escape , freely predicted that he would not be long in gaining his discharge from custody .\\n\\nonly dr . willett , who brought charles ward into the world and had watched his growth of body and mind ever since , seemed frightened at the thought of his future freedom . he had had a terrible experience and had made a terrible discovery which he dared not reveal to his sceptical colleagues . willett , indeed , presents a minor mystery all his own in his connexion with the case . he was the last to see the patient before his flight , and emerged from that final conversation in a state of mixed horror and relief which several recalled when ward\\'s escape became known three hours later . that escape itself is one of the unsolved wonders of dr . waite\\'s hospital . a window open above a sheer drop of sixty feet could hardly explain it , yet after that talk with willett the youth was undeniably gone . willett himself has no public explanations to offer , though he seems strangely easier in mind than before the escape . many , indeed , feel that he would like to say more if he thought any considerable number would believe him . he had found ward in his room , but shortly after his departure the attendants knocked in vain . when they opened the door the patient was not there , and all they found was the open window with a chill april breeze blowing in a cloud of fine bluish-grey dust that almost choked them . true , the dogs howled some time before ; but that was while willett was still present , and they had caught nothing and shewn no disturbance later on . ward\\'s father was told at once over the telephone , but he seemed more saddened than surprised . by the time dr . waite called in person , dr . willett had been talking with him , and both disavowed any knowledge or complicity in the escape . only from certain closely confidential friends of willett and the senior ward have any clues been gained , and even these are too wildly fantastic for general credence . the one fact which remains is that up to the present time no trace of the missing madman has been unearthed .\\n\\ncharles ward was an antiquarian from infancy , no doubt gaining his taste from the venerable town around him , and from the relics of the past which filled every corner of his parents\\' old mansion in prospect street on the crest of the hill . with the years his devotion to ancient things increased ; so that history , genealogy , and the study of colonial architecture , furniture , and craftsmanship at length crowded everything else from his sphere of interests . these tastes are important to remember in considering his madness ; for although they do not form its absolute nucleus , they play a prominent part in its superficial form . the gaps of information which the alienists noticed were all related to modern matters , and were invariably offset by a correspondingly excessive though outwardly concealed knowledge of bygone matters as brought out by adroit questioning ; so that one would have fancied the patient literally transferred to a former age through some obscure sort of auto-hypnosis . the odd thing was that ward seemed no longer interested in the antiquities he knew so well . he had , it appears , lost his regard for them through sheer familiarity ; and all his final efforts were obviously bent toward mastering those common facts of the modern world which had been so totally and unmistakably expunged from his brain . that this wholesale deletion had occurred , he did his best to hide ; but it was clear to all who watched him that his whole programme of reading and conversation was determined by a frantic wish to imbibe such knowledge of his own life and of the ordinary practical and cultural background of the twentieth century as ought to have been his by virtue of his birth in 1902 and his education in the schools of our own time . alienists are now wondering how , in view of his vitally impaired range of data , the escaped patient manages to cope with the complicated world of today ; the dominant opinion being that he is \"lying low\" in some humble and unexacting position till his stock of modern information can be brought up to the normal .\\n\\nthe beginning of ward\\'s madness is a matter of dispute among alienists . dr . lyman , the eminent boston authority , places it in 1919 or 1920 , during the boy\\'s last year at the moses brown school , when he suddenly turned from the study of the past to the study of the occult , and refused to qualify for college on the ground that he had individual researches of much greater importance to make . this is certainly borne out by ward\\'s altered habits at the time , especially by his continual search through town records and among old burying-grounds for a certain grave dug in 1771 ; the grave of an ancestor named joseph curwen , some of whose papers he professed to have found behind the panelling of a very old house in olney court , on stampers\\' hill , which curwen was known to have built and occupied . it is , broadly speaking , undeniable that the winter of 1919-20 saw a great change in ward ; whereby he abruptly stopped his general antiquarian pursuits and embarked on a desperate delving into occult subjects both at home and abroad , varied only by this strangely persistent search for his forefather\\'s grave .\\n\\nfrom this opinion , however , dr . willett substantially dissents ; basing his verdict on his close and continuous knowledge of the patient , and on certain frightful investigations and discoveries which he made toward the last . those investigations and discoveries have left their mark upon him ; so that his voice trembles when he tells them , and his hand trembles when he tries to write of them . willett admits that the change of 1919-20 would ordinarily appear to mark the beginning of a progressive decadence which culminated in the horrible and uncanny alienation of 1928 ; but believes from personal observation that a finer distinction must be made . granting freely that the boy was always ill-balanced temperamentally , and prone to be unduly susceptible and enthusiastic in his responses to phenomena around him , he refuses to concede that the early alteration marked the actual passage from sanity to madness ; crediting instead ward\\'s own statement that he had discovered or rediscovered something whose effect on human though was likely to be marvellous and profound . the true madness , he is certain , came with a later change ; after the curwen portrait and the ancient papers had been unearthed ; after a trip to strange foreign places had been made , and some terrible invocations chanted under strange and secret circumstances ; after certain answers to these invocations had been plainly indicated , and a frantic letter penned under agonising and inexplicable conditions ; after the wave of vampirism and the ominous pawtuxet gossip ; and after the patient\\'s memory commenced to exclude contemporary images whilst his physical aspect underwent the subtle modification so many subsequently noticed .\\n\\nit was only about this time , willett points out with much acuteness , that the nightmare qualities became indubitably linked with ward ; and the doctor feels shudderingly sure that enough solid evidence exists to sustain the youth\\'s claim regarding his crucial discovery . in the first place , two workmen of high intelligence saw joseph curwen\\'s ancient papers found . secondly , the boy once shewed dr . willett those papers and a page of the curwen diary , and each of the documents had every appearance of genuineness . the hole where ward claimed to have found them was long a visible reality , and willett had a very convincing final glimpse of them in surroundings which can scarcely be believed and can never perhaps be proved . then there were the mysteries and coincidences of the orne and hutchinson letters , and the problem of the curwen penmanship and of what the detectives brought to light about dr . allen ; these things , and the terrible message in mediaeval minuscules found in willett\\'s pocket when he gained consciousness after his shocking experience .\\n\\nand most conclusive of all , there are the two hideous results which the doctor obtained from a certain pair of formulae during his final investigations ; results which virtually proved the authenticity of the papers and of their monstrous implications at the same time that those papers were borne forever from human knowledge .\\n\\n2\\n\\none must look back at charles ward\\'s earlier life as at something belonging as much to the past as the antiquities he loved so keenly . in the autumn of 1918 , and with a considerable show of zest in the military training of the period , he had begun his junior year at the moses brown school , which lies very near his home . the old main building , erected in 1819 , had always charmed his youthful antiquarian sense ; and the spacious park in which the academy is set appealed to his sharp eye for landscape . his social activities were few ; and his hours were spent mainly at home , in rambling walks , in his classes and drills , and in pursuit of antiquarian and genealogical data at the city hall , the state house , the public library , the athenaeum , the historical society , the john carter brown and john hay libraries of brown university , and the newly opened shepley library in benefit street . one may picture him yet as he was in those days ; tall , slim , and blond , with studious eyes and a slight stoop , dressed somewhat carelessly , and giving a dominant impression of harmless awkwardness rather than attractiveness .\\n\\nhis walks were always adventures in antiquity , during which he managed to recapture from the myriad relics of a glamorous old city a vivid and connected picture of the centuries before . his home was a great georgian mansion atop the well-nigh precipitous hill that rises just east of the river ; and from the rear windows of its rambling wings he could look dizzily out over all the clustered spires , domes , roofs , and skyscraper summits of the lower town to the purple hills of the countryside beyond . here he was born , and from the lovely classic porch of the double-bayed brick facade his nurse had first wheeled him in his carriage ; past the little white farmhouse of two hundred years before that the town had long ago overtaken , and on toward the stately colleges along the shady , sumptuous street , whose old square brick mansions and smaller wooden houses with narrow , heavy-columned doric porches dreamed solid and exclusive amidst their generous yards and gardens .\\n\\nhe had been wheeled , too , along sleepy congdon street , one tier lower down on the steep hill , and with all its eastern homes on high terraces . the small wooden houses averaged a greater age here , for it was up this hill that the growing town had climbed ; and in these rides he had imbibed something of the colour of a quaint colonial village . the nurse used to stop and sit on the benches of prospect terrace to chat with policemen ; and one of the child\\'s first memories was of the great westward sea of hazy roofs and domes and steeples and far hills which he saw one winter afternoon from that great railed embankment , all violet and mystic against a fevered , apocalyptic sunset of reds and golds and purples and curious greens . the vast marble dome of the state house stood out in massive silhouette , its crowning statue haloed fantastically by a break in one of the tinted stratus clouds that barred the flaming sky .\\n\\nwhen he was larger his famous walks began ; first with his impatiently dragged nurse , and then alone in dreamy meditation . farther and farther down that almost perpendicular hill he would venture , each time reaching older and quainter levels of the ancient city . he would hesitate gingerly down vertical jenckes street with its bank walls and colonial gables to the shady benefit street corner , where before him was a wooden antique with an ionic-pilastered pair of doorways , and beside him a prehistoric gambrel-roofer with a bit of primal farmyard remaining , and the great judge durfee house with its fallen vestiges of georgian grandeur . it was getting to be a slum here ; but the titan elms cast a restoring shadow over the place , and the boy used to stroll south past the long lines of the pre-revolutionary homes with their great central chimneys and classic portals . on the eastern side they were set high over basements with railed double flights of stone steps , and the young charles could picture them as they were when the street was new , and red heels and periwigs set off the painted pediments whose signs of wear were now becoming so visible .\\n\\nwestward the hill dropped almost as steeply as above , down to the old \"town street\" that the founders had laid out at the river\\'s edge in 1636 . here ran innumerable little lanes with leaning , huddled houses of immense antiquity ; and fascinated though he was , it was long before he dared to thread their archaic verticality for fear they would turn out a dream or a gateway to unknown terrors . he found it much less formidable to continue along benefit street past the iron fence of st . john\\'s hidden churchyard and the rear of the 1761 colony house and the mouldering bulk of the golden ball inn where washington stopped . at meeting street--the successive gaol lane and king street of other periods--he would look upward to the east and see the arched flight of steps to which the highway had to resort in climbing the slope , and downward to the west , glimpsing the old brick colonial schoolhouse that smiles across the road at the ancient sign of shakespeare\\'s head where the providence gazette and country-journal was printed before the revolution . then came the exquisite first baptist church of 1775 , luxurious with its matchless gibbs steeple , and the georgian roofs and cupolas hovering by . here and to the southward the neighbourhood became better , flowering at last into a marvellous group of early mansions ; but still the little ancient lanes led off down the precipice to the west , spectral in their many-gabled archaism and dipping to a riot of iridescent decay where the wicked old water-front recalls its proud east india days amidst polyglot vice and squalor , rotting wharves , and blear-eyed ship-chandleries , with such surviving alley names as packet , bullion , gold , silver , coin , doubloon , sovereign , guilder , dollar , dime , and cent .\\n\\nsometimes , as he grew taller and more adventurous , young ward would venture down into this maelstrom of tottering houses , broken transoms , tumbling steps , twisted balustrades , swarthy faces , and nameless odours ; winding from south main to south water , searching out the docks where the bay and sound steamers still touched , and returning northward at this lower level past the steep-roofed 1816 warehouses and the broad square at the great bridge , where the 1773 market house still stands firm on its ancient arches . in that square he would pause to drink in the bewildering beauty of the old town as it rises on its eastward bluff , decked with its two georgian spires and crowned by the vast new christian science dome as london is crowned by st . paul\\'s . he like mostly to reach this point in the late afternoon , when the slanting sunlight touches the market house and the ancient hill roofs and belfries with gold , and throws magic around the dreaming wharves where providence indiamen used to ride at anchor . after a long look he would grow almost dizzy with a poet\\'s love for the sight , and then he would scale the slope homeward in the dusk past the old white church and up the narrow precipitous ways where yellow gleams would begin to peep out in small-paned windows and through fanlights set high over double flights of steps with curious wrought-iron railings .\\n\\nat other times , and in later years , he would seek for vivid contrasts ; spending half a walk in the crumbling colonial regions northwest of his home , where the hill drops to the lower eminence of stampers\\' hill with its ghetto and negro quarter clustering round the place where the boston stage coach used to start before the revolution , and the other half in the gracious southerly realm about george , benevolent , power , and williams streets , where the old slope holds unchanged the fine estates and bits of walled garden and steep green lane in which so many fragrant memories linger . these rambles , together with the diligent studies which accompanied them , certainly account for a large amount of the antiquarian lore which at last crowded the modern world from charles ward\\'s mind ; and illustrate the mental soil upon which fell , in that fateful winter of 1919-20 , the seeds that came to such strange and terrible fruition .\\n\\ndr . willett is certain that , up to this ill-omened winter of first change , charles ward\\'s antiquarianism was free from every trace of the morbid . graveyards held for him no particular attraction beyond their quaintness and historic value , and of anything like violence or savage instinct he was utterly devoid . then , by insidious degrees , there appeared to develop a curious sequel to one of his genealogical triumphs of the year before ; when he had discovered among his maternal ancestors a certain very long-lived man named joseph curwen , who had come from salem in march of 1692 , and about whom a whispered series of highly peculiar and disquieting stories clustered .\\n\\nward\\'s great-great-grandfather welcome potter had in 1785 married a certain \\'ann tillinghast , daughter of mrs . eliza , daughter to capt . james tillinghast ,\\' of whose paternity the family had preserved no trace . late in 1918 , whilst examining a volume of original town records in manuscript , the young genealogist encountered an entry describing a legal change of name , by which in 1772 a mrs . eliza curwen , widow of joseph curwen , resumed , along with her seven-year-old daughter ann , her maiden name of tillinghast ; on the ground \\'that her husband\\'s name was become a public reproach by reason of what was knowne after his decease ; the which confirming an antient common rumour , tho\\' not to be credited by a loyall wife till so proven as to be wholely past doubting .\\'\\n\\nthis entry came to light upon the accidental separation of two leaves which had been carefully pasted together and treated as one by a laboured revision of the page numbers .\\n\\nit was at once clear to charles ward that he had indeed discovered a hitherto unknown great-great-great-grandfather . the discovery doubly excited him because he had already heard vague reports and seen scattered allusions relating to this person ; about whom there remained so few publicly available records , aside from those becoming public only in modern times , that it almost seemed as if a conspiracy had existed to blot him from memory . what did appear , moreover , was of such a singular and provocative nature that one could not fail to imagine curiously what it was that the colonial recorders were so anxious to conceal and forget ; or to suspect that the deletion had reasons all too valid .\\n\\nbefore this , ward had been content to let his romancing about old joseph curwen remain in the idle stage ; but having discovered his own relationship to this apparently \"hushed-up\" character , he proceeded to hunt out as systematically as possible whatever he might find concerning him . in this excited quest he eventually succeeded beyond his highest expectations ; for old letters , diaries , and sheaves of unpublished memoirs in cobwebbed providence garrets and elsewhere yielded many illuminating passages which their writers had not thought it worth their while to destroy . one important sidelight came from a point as remote as new york , where some rhode island colonial correspondence was stored in the museum at fraunces\\' tavern . the really crucial thing , though , and what in dr . willett\\'s opinion formed the definite source of ward\\'s undoing , was the matter found in august 1919 behind the panelling of the crumbling house in olney court . it was that , beyond a doubt , which opened up those black vistas whose end was deeper than the pit .\\n\\nii . an antecedent and a horror\\n\\n1\\n\\njoseph curwen , as revealed by the rambling legends embodied in what ward heard and unearthed , was a very astonishing , enigmatic , and obscurely horrible individual . he had fled from salem to providence--that universal haven of the odd , the free , and the dissenting--at the beginning of the great witchcraft panic ; being in fear of accusation because of his solitary ways and queer chemical or alchemical experiments . he was a colourless-looking man of about thirty , and was soon found qualified to become a freeman of providence ; thereafter buying a home lot just north of gregory dexter\\'s at about the foot of olney street . his house was built on stampers\\' hill west of the town street , in what later became olney court ; and in 1761 he replaced this with a larger one , on the same site , which is still standing .\\n\\nnow the first odd thing about joseph curwen was that he did not seem to grow much older than he had been on his arrival . he engaged in shipping enterprises , purchased wharfage near mile-end cove , helped rebuild the great bridge in 1713 , and in 1723 was one of the founders of the congregational church on the hill ; but always did he retain his nondescript aspect of a man not greatly over thirty or thirty-five . as decades mounted up , this singular quality began to excite wide notice ; but curwen always explained it by saying that he came of hardy forefathers , and practised a simplicity of living which did not wear him our . how such simplicity could be reconciled with the inexplicable comings and goings of the secretive merchant , and with the queer gleaming of his windows at all hours of night , was not very clear to the townsfolk ; and they were prone to assign other reasons for his continued youth and longevity . it was held , for the most part , that curwen\\'s incessant mixings and boilings of chemicals had much to do with his condition . gossip spoke of the strange substances he brought from london and the indies on his ships or purchased in newport , boston , and new york ; and when old dr . jabez bowen came from rehoboth and opened his apothecary shop across the great bridge at the sign of the unicorn and mortar , there was ceaseless talk of the drugs , acids , and metals that the taciturn recluse incessantly bought or ordered from him . acting on the assumption that curwen possessed a wondrous and secret medical skill , many sufferers of various sorts applied to him for aid ; but though he appeared to encourage their belief in a non-committal way , and always gave them odd-coloured potions in response to their requests , it was observed that his ministrations to others seldom proved of benefit . at length , when over fifty years had passed since the stranger\\'s advent , and without producing more than five years\\' apparent change in his face and physique , the people began to whisper more darkly ; and to meet more than half way that desire for isolation which he had always shewn .\\n\\nprivate letters and diaries of the period reveal , too , a multitude of other reasons why joseph curwen was marvelled at , feared , and finally shunned like a plague . his passion for graveyards , in which he was glimpsed at all hours , and under all conditions , was notorious ; though no one had witnessed any deed on his part which could actually be termed ghoulish . on the pawtuxet road he had a farm , at which he generally lived during the summer , and to which he would frequently be seen riding at various odd times of the day or night . here his only visible servants , farmers , and caretakers were a sullen pair of aged narragansett indians ; the husband dumb and curiously scarred , and the wife of a very repulsive cast of countenance , probably due to a mixture of negro blood . in the lean-to of this house was the laboratory where most of the chemical experiments were conducted . curious porters and teamers who delivered bottles , bags , or boxes at the small rear door would exchange accounts of the fantastic flasks , crucibles , alembics , and furnaces they saw in the low shelved room ; and prophesied in whispers that the close-mouthed \"chymist\"--by which they meant alchemist--would not be long in finding the philosopher\\'s stone . the nearest neighbours to this farm--the fenners , a quarter of a mile away--had still queerer things to tell of certain sounds which they insisted came from the curwen place in the night . there were cries , they said , and sustained howlings ; and they did not like the large numbers of livestock which thronged the pastures , for no such amount was needed to keep a lone old man and a very few servants in meat , milk , and wool . the identity of the stock seemed to change from week to week as new droves were purchased from the kingstown farmers . then , too , there was something very obnoxious about a certain great stone outbuilding with only high narrow slits for windows .\\n\\ngreat bridge idlers likewise had much to say of curwen\\'s town house in olney court ; not so much the fine new one built in 1761 , when the man must have been nearly a century old , but the first low gambrel-roofed one with the windowless attic and shingled sides , whose timbers he took the peculiar precaution of burning after its demolition . here there was less mystery , it is true ; but the hours at which lights were seen , the secretiveness of the two swarthy foreigners who comprised the only menservants , the hideous indistinct mumbling of the incredibly aged french housekeeper , the large amounts of food seen to enter a door within which only four persons lived , and the quality of certain voices often heard in muffled conversation at highly unseasonable times , all combined with what was known of the pawtuxet farm to give the place a bad name .\\n\\nin choicer circles , too , the curwen home was by no means undiscussed ; for as the newcomer had gradually worked into the church and trading life of the town , he had naturally made acquaintances of the better sort , whose company and conversation he was well fitted by education to enjoy . his birth was known to be good , since the curwens or corwins of salem needed no introduction in new england . it developed that joseph curwen had travelled much in very early life , living for a time in england and making at least two voyages to the orient ; and his speech , when he deigned to use it , was that of a learned and cultivated englishman . but for some reason or other curwen did not care for society . whilst never actually rebuffing a visitor , he always reared such a wall of reserve that few could think of anything to say to him which would not sound inane .\\n\\nthere seemed to lurk in his bearing some cryptic , sardonic arrogance , as if he had come to find all human beings dull through having moved among stranger and more potent entities . when dr . checkley the famous wit came from boston in 1738 to be rector of king\\'s church , he did not neglect calling on one of whom he soon heard so much ; but left in a very short while because of some sinister undercurrent he detected in his host\\'s discourse . charles ward told his father , when they discussed curwen one winter evening , that he would give much to learn what the mysterious old man had said to the sprightly cleric , but that all diarists agree concerning dr . checkley\\'s reluctance to repeat anything he had heard . the good man had been hideously shocked , and could never recall joseph curwen without a visible loss of the gay urbanity for which he was famed .\\n\\nmore definite , however , was the reason why another man of taste and breeding avoided the haughty hermit . in 1746 mr . john merritt , an elderly english gentleman of literary and scientific leanings , came from newport to the town which was so rapidly overtaking it in standing , and built a fine country seat on the neck in what is now the heart of the best residence section . he lived in considerable style and comfort , keeping the first coach and liveried servants in town , and taking great pride in his telescope , his microscope , and his well-chosen library of english and latin books . hearing of curwen as the owner of the best library in providence , mr . merritt early paid him a call , and was more cordially received than most other callers at the house had been . his admiration for his host\\'s ample shelves , which besides the greek , latin , and english classics were equipped with a remarkable battery of philosophical , mathematical , and scientific works including paracelsus , agricola , van helmont , sylvius , glauber , boyle , boerhaave , becher , and stahl , led curwen to suggest a visit to the farmhouse and laboratory whither he had never invited anyone before ; and the two drove out at once in mr . merritt\\'s coach .\\n\\nmr . merritt always confessed to seeing nothing really horrible at the farmhouse , but maintained that the titles of the books in the special library of thaumaturgical , alchemical , and theological subjects which curwen kept in a front room were alone sufficient to inspire him with a lasting loathing . perhaps , however , the facial expression of the owner in exhibiting them contributed much of the prejudice . this bizarre collection , besides a host of standard works which mr . merritt was not too alarmed to envy , embraced nearly all the cabbalists , daemonologists , and magicians known to man ; and was a treasure-house of lore in the doubtful realms of alchemy and astrology . hermes trismegistus in mesnard\\'s edition , the turba philosophorum , geber\\'s liber investigationis , and artephius\\'s key of wisdom all were there ; with the cabbalistic zohar , peter jammy\\'s set of albertus magnus , raymond lully\\'s ars magna et ultima in zetsner\\'s edition , roger bacon\\'s thesaurus chemicus , fludd\\'s clavis alchimiae , and trithemius\\'s de lapide philosophico crowding them close . mediaeval jews and arabs were represented in profusion , and mr . merritt turned pale when , upon taking down a fine volume conspicuously labelled as the qanoon-e-islam , he found it was in truth the forbidden necronomicon of the mad arab abdul alhazred , of which he had heard such monstrous things whispered some years previously after the exposure of nameless rites at the strange little fishing village of kingsport , in the province of the massachussetts-bay .\\n\\nbut oddly enough , the worthy gentleman owned himself most impalpably disquieted by a mere minor detail . on the huge mahogany table there lay face downwards a badly worn copy of borellus , bearing many cryptical marginalia and interlineations in curwen\\'s hand . the book was open at about its middle , and one paragraph displayed such thick and tremulous pen-strokes beneath the lines of mystic black-letter that the visitor could not resist scanning it through . whether it was the nature of the passage underscored , or the feverish heaviness of the strokes which formed the underscoring , he could not tell ; but something in that combination affected him very badly and very peculiarly . he recalled it to the end of his days , writing it down from memory in his diary and once trying to recite it to his close friend dr . checkley till he saw how greatly it disturbed the urbane rector . it read :\\n\\n\\'the essential saltes of animals may be so prepared and preserved , that an ingenious man may have the whole ark of noah in his own studie , and raise the fine shape of an animal out of its ashes at his pleasure ; and by the lyke method from the essential saltes of humane dust , a philosopher may , without any criminal necromancy , call up the shape of any dead ancestour from the dust whereinto his bodie has been incinerated .\\'\\n\\nit was near the docks along the southerly part of the town street , however , that the worst things were muttered about joseph curwen . sailors are superstitious folk ; and the seasoned salts who manned the infinite rum , slave , and molasses sloops , the rakish privateers , and the great brigs of the browns , crawfords , and tillinghasts , all made strange furtive signs of protection when they saw the slim , deceptively young-looking figure with its yellow hair and slight stoop entering the curwen warehouse in doubloon street or talking with captains and supercargoes on the long quay where the curwen ships rode restlessly . curwen\\'s own clerks and captains hated and feared him , and all his sailors were mongrel riff-raff from martinique , st . eustatius , havana , or port royal . it was , in a way , the frequency with which these sailors were replaced which inspired the acutest and most tangible part of the fear in which the old man was held . a crew would be turned loose in the town on shore leave , some of its members perhaps charged with this errand or that ; and when reassembled it would be almost sure to lack one or more men . that many of the errands had concerned the farm of pawtuxet road , and that few of the sailors had ever been seen to return from that place , was not forgotten ; so that in time it became exceedingly difficult for curwen to keep his oddly assorted hands . almost invariably several would desert soon after hearing the gossip of the providence wharves , and their replacement in the west indies became an increasingly great problem to the merchant .\\n\\nby 1760 joseph curwen was virtually an outcast , suspected of vague horrors and daemoniac alliances which seemed all the more menacing because they could not be named , understood , or even proved to exist . the last straw may have come from the affair of the missing soldiers in 1758 , for in march and april of that year two royal regiments on their way to new france were quartered in providence , and depleted by an inexplicable process far beyond the average rate of desertion . rumour dwelt on the frequency with which curwen was wont to be seen talking with the red-coated strangers ; and as several of them began to be missed , people thought of the odd conditions among his own seamen . what would have happened if the regiments had not been ordered on , no one can tell .\\n\\nmeanwhile the merchant\\'s worldly affairs were prospering . he had a virtual monopoly of the town\\'s trade in saltpetre , black pepper , and cinnamon , and easily led any other one shipping establishment save the browns in his importation of brassware , indigo , cotton , woollens , salt , rigging , iron , paper , and english goods of every kind . such shopkeepers as james green , at the sign of the elephant in cheapside , the russells , at the sign of the golden eagle across the bridge , or clark and nightingale at the frying-pan and fish near new coffee-house , depended almost wholly upon him for their stock ; and his arrangements with the local distillers , the narragansett dairymen and horse-breeders , and the newport candle-makers , made him one of the prime exporters of the colony .\\n\\nostracised though he was , he did not lack for civic spirit of a sort . when the colony house burned down , he subscribed handsomely to the lotteries by which the new brick one--still standing at the head of its parade in the old main street--was built in 1761 . in that same year , too , he helped rebuild the great bridge after the october gale . he replaced many of the books of the public library consumed in the colony house fire , and bought heavily in the lottery that gave the muddy market parade and deep-rutted town street their pavement of great round stones with a brick footwalk or \"causey\" in the middle . about this time , also , he built the plain but excellent new house whose doorway is still such a triumph of carving . when the whitefield adherents broke off from dr . cotton\\'s hill church in 1743 and founded deacon snow\\'s church across the bridge , curwen had gone with them ; though his zeal and attendance soon abated . now , however , he cultivated piety once more ; as if to dispel the shadow which had thrown him into isolation and would soon begin to wreck his business fortunes if not sharply checked .\\n\\n2\\n\\nthe sight of this strange , pallid man , hardly middle-aged in aspect yet certainly not less than a full century old , seeking at last to emerge from a cloud of fright and detestation too vague to pin down or analyse , was at once a pathetic , a dramatic , and a contemptible thing . such is the power of wealth and of surface gestures , however , that there came indeed a slight abatement in the visible aversion displayed toward him ; especially after the rapid disappearances of his sailors abruptly ceased . he must likewise have begun to practice an extreme care and secrecy in his graveyard expeditions , for he was never again caught at such wanderings ; whilst the rumours of uncanny sounds and manoeuvres at his pawtuxet farm diminished in proportion . his rate of food consumption and cattle replacement remained abnormally high ; but not until modern times , when charles ward examined a set of his accounts and invoices in the shepley library , did it occur to any person--save one embittered youth , perhaps--to make dark comparisons between the large number of guinea blacks he imported until 1766 , and the disturbingly small number for whom he could produce bona fide bills of sale either to slave-dealers at the great bridge or to the planters of the narragansett country . certainly , the cunning and ingenuity of this abhorred character were uncannily profound , once the necessity for their exercise had become impressed upon him .\\n\\nbut of course the effect of all this belated mending was necessarily slight . curwen continued to be avoided and distrusted , as indeed the one fact of his continued air of youth at a great age would have been enough to warrant ; and he could see that in the end his fortunes would be likely to suffer . his elaborate studies and experiments , whatever they may have been , apparently required a heavy income for their maintenance ; and since a change of environment would deprive him of the trading advantages he had gained , it would not have profited him to begin anew in a different region just then . judgement demanded that he patch up his relations with the townsfolk of providence , so that his presence might no longer be a signal for hushed conversation , transparent excuses or errands elsewhere , and a general atmosphere of constraint and uneasiness . his clerks , being now reduced to the shiftless and impecunious residue whom no one else would employ , were giving him much worry ; and he held to his sea-captains and mates only by shrewdness in gaining some kind of ascendancy over them--a mortgage , a promissory note , or a bit of information very pertinent to their welfare . in many cases , diarists have recorded with some awe , curwen shewed almost the power of a wizard in unearthing family secrets for questionable use . during the final five years of his life it seemed as though only direct talks with the long-dead could possibly have furnished some of the data which he had so glibly at his tongue\\'s end .\\n\\nabout this time the crafty scholar hit upon a last desperate expedient to regain his footing in the community . hitherto a complete hermit , he now determined to contract an advantageous marriage ; securing as a bride some lady whose unquestioned position would make all ostracism of his home impossible . it may be that he also had deeper reasons for wishing an alliance ; reasons so far outside the known cosmic sphere that only papers found a century and a half after his death caused anyone to suspect them ; but of this nothing certain can ever be learned . naturally he was aware of the horror and indignation with which any ordinary courtship of his would be received , hence he looked about for some likely candidate upon whose parents he might exert a suitable pressure . such candidates , he found , were not at all easy to discover ; since he had very particular requirements in the way of beauty , accomplishments , and social security . at length his survey narrowed down to the household of one of his best and oldest ship-captains , a widower of high birth and unblemished standing named dutee tillinghast , whose only daughter eliza seemed dowered with every conceivable advantage save prospects as an heiress . capt . tillinghast was completely under the domination of curwen ; and consented , after a terrible interview in his cupolaed house on power\\'s lane hill , to sanction the blasphemous alliance .\\n\\neliza tillinghast was at that time eighteen years of age , and had been reared as gently as the reduced circumstances of her father permitted . she had attended stephen jackson\\'s school opposite the court-house parade ; and had been diligently instructed by her mother , before the latter\\'s death of smallpox in 1757 , in all the arts and refinements of domestic life . a sampler of hers , worked in 1753 at the age of nine , may still be found in the rooms of the rhode island historical society . after her mother\\'s death she had kept the house , aided only by one old black woman . her arguments with her father concerning the proposed curwen marriage must have been painful indeed ; but of these we have no record . certain it is that her engagement to young ezra weeden , second mate of the crawford packet enterprise , was dutifully broken off , and that her union with joseph curwen took place on the seventh of march , 1763 , in the baptist church , in the presence of the most distinguished assemblages which the town could boast ; the ceremony being performed by the younger samuel winsor . the gazette mentioned the event very briefly , and in most surviving copies the item in question seems to be cut or torn out . ward found a single intact copy after much search in the archives of a private collector of note , observing with amusement the meaningless urbanity of the language :\\n\\n\\'monday evening last , mr . joseph curwen , of this town , merchant , was married to miss eliza tillinghast , daughter of capt . dutee tillinghast , a young lady who has real merit , added to a beautiful person , to grace the connubial state and perpetuate its felicity .\\'\\n\\nthe collection of durfee-arnold letters , discovered by charles ward shortly before his first reputed madness in the private collection of melville f . peters , esq . , of george st . , and covering this and a somewhat antecedent period , throws vivid light on the outrage done to public sentiment by this ill-assorted match . the social influence of the tillinghasts , however , was not to be denied ; and once more joseph curwen found his house frequented by persons whom he could never otherwise have induced to cross his threshold . his acceptance was by no means complete , and his bride was socially the sufferer through her forced venture ; but at all events the wall of utter ostracism was somewhat torn down . in his treatment of his wife the strange bridegroom astonished both her and the community by displaying an extreme graciousness and consideration . the new house in olney court was now wholly free from disturbing manifestations , and although curwen was much absent at the pawtuxet farm which his wife never visited , he seemed more like a normal citizen than at any other time in his long years of residence . only one person remained in open enmity with him , this being the youthful ship\\'s officer whose engagement to eliza tillinghast had been so abruptly broken . ezra weeden had frankly vowed vengeance ; and though of a quiet and ordinarily mild disposition , was now gaining a hate-bred , dogged purpose which boded no good to the usurping husband .\\n\\non the seventh of may , 1765 , curwen\\'s only child ann was born ; and was christened by the rev . john graves of king\\'s church , of which both husband and wife had become communicants shortly after their marriage , in order to compromise between their respective congregational and baptist affiliations . the record of this birth , as well as that of the marriage two years before , was stricken from most copies of the church and town annals where it ought to appear ; and charles ward located both with the greatest difficulty after his discovery of the widow\\'s change of name had apprised him of his own relationship , and engendered the feverish interest which culminated in his madness . the birth entry , indeed , was found very curiously through correspondence with the heirs of the loyalist dr . graves , who had taken with him a duplicate set of records when he left his pastorate at the outbreak of the revolution . ward had tried this source because he knew that his great-great-grandmother ann tillinghast potter had been an episcopalian .\\n\\nshortly after the birth of his daughter , an event he seemed to welcome with a fervour greatly out of keeping with his usual coldness , curwen resolved to sit for a portrait . this he had painted by a very gifted scotsman named cosmo alexander , then a resident of newport , and since famous as the early teacher of gilbert stuart . the likeness was said to have been executed on a wall-panel of the library of the house in olney court , but neither of the two old diaries mentioning it gave any hint of its ultimate disposition . at this period the erratic scholar shewed signs of unusual abstraction , and spent as much time as he possibly could at his farm on the pawtuxet road . he seemed , as was stated , in a condition of suppressed excitement or suspense ; as if expecting some phenomenal thing or on the brink of some strange discovery . chemistry or alchemy would appear to have played a great part , for he took from his house to the farm the greater number of his volumes on that subject .\\n\\nhis affectation of civic interest did not diminish , and he lost no opportunities for helping such leaders as stephen hopkins , joseph brown , and benjamin west in their efforts to raise the cultural tone of the town , which was then much below the level of newport in its patronage of the liberal arts . he had helped daniel jenckes found his bookshop in 1763 , and was thereafter his best customer ; extending aid likewise to the struggling gazette that appeared each wednesday at the sign of shakespeare\\'s head . in politics he ardently supported governor hopkins against the ward party whose prime strength was in newport , and his really eloquent speech at hacher\\'s hall in 1765 against the setting off of north providence as a separate town with a pro-ward vote in the general assembly did more than any other thing to wear down the prejudice against him . but ezra weeden , who watched him closely , sneered cynically at all this outward activity ; and freely swore it was no more than a mask for some nameless traffick with the blackest gulfs of tartarus . the revengeful youth began a systematic study of the man and his doings whenever he was in port ; spending hours at night by the wharves with a dory in readiness when he saw lights in the curwen warehouses , and following the small boat which would sometimes steal quietly off and down the bay . he also kept as close a watch as possible on the pawtuxet farm , and was once severely bitten by the dogs the old indian couple loosed upon him .\\n\\n3\\n\\nin 1766 came the final change in joseph curwen . it was very sudden , and gained wide notice amongst the curious townsfolk ; for the air of suspense and expectancy dropped like an old cloak , giving instant place to an ill-concealed exaltation of perfect triumph . curwen seemed to have difficulty in restraining himself from public harangues on what he had found or learned or made ; but apparently the need of secrecy was greater than the longing to share his rejoicing , for no explanation was ever offered by him . it was after this transition , which appears to have come early in july , that the sinister scholar began to astonish people by his possession of information which only their long-dead ancestors would seem to be able to impart .\\n\\nbut curwen\\'s feverish secret activities by no means ceased with this change . on the contrary , they tended rather to increase ; so that more and more of his shipping business was handled by the captains whom he now bound to him by ties of fear as potent as those of bankruptcy had been . he altogether abandoned the slave trade , alleging that its profits were constantly decreasing . every possible moment was spent at the pawtuxet farm ; although there were rumours now and then of his presence in places which , though not actually near graveyards , were yet so situated in relation to graveyards that thoughtful people wondered just how thorough the old merchant\\'s change of habits really was . ezra weeden , though his periods of espionage were necessarily brief and intermittent on account of his sea voyaging , had a vindictive persistence which the bulk of the practical townsfolk and farmers lacked ; and subjected curwen\\'s affairs to a scrutiny such as they had never had before .\\n\\nmany of the odd manoeuvres of the strange merchant\\'s vessels had been taken for granted on account of the unrest of the times , when every colonist seemed determined to resist the provisions of the sugar act which hampered a prominent traffick . smuggling and evasion were the rule in narragansett bay , and nocturnal landings of illicit cargoes were continuous commonplaces . but weeden , night after night following the lighters or small sloops which he saw steal off from the curwen warehouses at the town street docks , soon felt assured that it was not merely his majesty\\'s armed ships which the sinister skulker was anxious to avoid . prior to the change in 1766 these boats had for the most part contained chained negroes , who were carried down and across the bay and landed at an obscure point on the shore just north of pawtuxet ; being afterward driven up the bluff and across country to the curwen farm , where they were locked in that enormous stone outbuilding which had only five high narrow slits for windows . after that change , however , the whole programme was altered . importation of slaves ceased at once , and for a time curwen abandoned his midnight sailings . then , about the spring of 1767 , a new policy appeared . once more the lighters grew wont to put out from the black , silent docks , and this time they would go down the bay some distance , perhaps as far as namquit point , where they would meet and receive cargo from strange ships of considerable size and widely varied appearance . curwen\\'s sailors would then deposit this cargo at the usual point on the shore , and transport it overland to the farm ; locking it in the same cryptical stone building which had formerly received the negroes . the cargo consisted almost wholly of boxes and cases , of which a large proportion were oblong and heavy and disturbingly suggestive of coffins .\\n\\nweeden always watched the farm with unremitting assiduity ; visiting it each night for long periods , and seldom letting a week go by without a sight except when the ground bore a footprint-revealing snow . even then he would often walk as close as possible in the travelled road or on the ice of the neighbouring river to see what tracks others might have left . finding his own vigils interrupted by nautical duties , he hired a tavern companion named eleazar smith to continue the survey during his absence ; and between them the two could have set in motion some extraordinary rumours . that they did not do so was only because they knew the effect of publicity would be to warn their quarry and make further progress impossible . instead , they wished to learn something definite before taking any action . what they did learn must have been startling indeed , and charles ward spoke many times to his parents of his regret at weeden\\'s later burning of his notebooks . all that can be told of their discoveries is what eleazar smith jotted down in a non too coherent diary , and what other diarists and letter-writers have timidly repeated from the statements which they finally made--and according to which the farm was only the outer shell of some vast and revolting menace , of a scope and depth too profound and intangible for more than shadowy comprehension .\\n\\nit is gathered that weeden and smith became early convinced that a great series of tunnels and catacombs , inhabited by a very sizeable staff of persons besides the old indian and his wife , underlay the farm . the house was an old peaked relic of the middle seventeenth century with enormous stack chimney and diamond-paned lattice windows , the laboratory being in a lean-to toward the north , where the roof came nearly to the ground . this building stood clear of any other ; yet judging by the different voices heard at odd times within , it must have been accessible through secret passages beneath . these voices , before 1766 , were mere mumblings and negro whisperings and frenzied screams , coupled with curious chants or invocations . after that date , however , they assumed a very singular and terrible cast as they ran the gamut betwixt dronings of dull acquiescence and explosions of frantic pain or fury , rumblings of conversations and whines of entreaty , pantings of eagerness and shouts of protest . they appeared to be in different languages , all known to curwen , whose rasping accents were frequently distinguishable in reply , reproof , or threatening . sometimes it seemed that several persons must be in the house ; curwen , certain captives , and the guards of those captives . there were voices of a sort that neither weeden nor smith had ever heard before despite their wide knowledge of foreign parts , and many that they did seem to place as belonging to this or that nationality . the nature of the conversations seemed always a kind of catechism , as if curwen were extorting some sort of information from terrified or rebellious prisoners .\\n\\nweeden had many verbatim reports of overheard scraps in his notebook , for english , french , and spanish , which he knew , were frequently used ; but of these nothing has survived . he did , however , say that besides a few ghoulish dialogues in which the past affairs of providence families were concerned , most of the questions and answers he could understand were historical or scientific ; occasionally pertaining to very remote places and ages . once , for example , an alternately raging and sullen figure was questioned in french about the black prince\\'s massacre at limoges in 1370 , as if there were some hidden reason which he ought to know . curwen asked the prisoner--if prisoner he were--whether the order to slay was given because of the sign of the goat found on the altar in the ancient roman crypt beneath the cathedral , or whether the dark man of the haute vienne had spoken the three words . failing to obtain replies , the inquisitor had seemingly resorted to extreme means ; for there was a terrific shriek followed by silence and muttering and a bumping sound .\\n\\nnone of these colloquies was ever ocularly witnessed , since the windows were always heavily draped . once , though , during a discourse in an unknown tongue , a shadow was seen on the curtain which startled weeden exceedingly ; reminding him of one of the puppets in a show he had seen in the autumn of 1764 in hacher\\'s hall , when a man from germantown , pennsylvania , had given a clever mechanical spectacle advertised as\\n\\n\\'a view of the famous city of jerusalem , in which are represented jerusalem , the temple of solomon , his royal throne , the noted towers , and hills , likewise the suffering of our saviour from the garden of gethsemane to the cross on the hill of golgotha ; an artful piece of statuary , worthy to be seen by the curious .\\'\\n\\nit was on this occasion that the listener , who had crept close to the window of the front room whence the speaking proceeded , gave a start which roused the old indian pair and caused them to loose the dogs on him . after that no more conversations were ever heard in the house , and weeden and smith concluded that curwen had transferred his field of action to regions below .\\n\\nthat such regions in truth existed , seemed amply clear from many things . faint cries and groans unmistakably came up now and then from what appeared to be the solid earth in places far from any structure ; whilst hidden in the bushes along the river-bank in the rear , where the high ground sloped steeply down to the valley of the pawtuxet , there was found an arched oaken door in a frame of heavy masonry , which was obviously an entrance to caverns within the hill . when or how these catacombs could have been constructed , weeden was unable to say ; but he frequently pointed out how easily the place might have been reached by bands of unseen workmen from the river . joseph curwen put his mongrel seamen to diverse uses indeed ! during the heavy spring rains of 1769 the two watchers kept a sharp eye on the steep river-bank to see if any subterrene secrets might be washed to light , and were rewarded by the sight of a profusion of both human and animal bones in places where deep gullies had been worn in the banks . naturally there might be many explanations of such things in the rear of a stock farm , and a locality where old indian bury-grounds were common , but weeden and smith drew their own inferences .\\n\\nit was in january 1770 , whilst weeden and smith were still debating vainly on what , if anything , to think or do about the whole bewildering business , that the incident of the fortaleza occurred . exasperated by the burning of the revenue sloop liberty at newport during the previous summer , the customs fleet under admiral wallace had adopted an increased vigilance concerning strange vessels ; and on this occasion his majesty\\'s armed schooner cygnet , under capt . charles leslie , captured after a short pursuit one early morning the scow fortaleza of barcelona , spain , under capt . manuel arruda , bound according to its log from grand cairo , egypt , to providence . when searched for contraband material , this ship revealed the astonishing fact that its cargo consisted exclusively of egyptian mummies , consigned to \"sailor a . b . c .\" , who would come to remove his goods in a lighter just off namquit point and whose identity capt . arruda felt himself in honour bound not to reveal . the vice-admiralty at newport , at a loss what to do in view of the non-contraband nature of the cargo on the one hand and of the unlawful secrecy of the entry on the other hand , compromised on collector robinson\\'s recommendation by freeing the ship but forbidding it a port in rhode island waters . there were later rumours of its having been seen in boston harbour , though it never openly entered the port of boston .\\n\\nthis extraordinary incident did not fail of wide remark in providence , and there were not many who doubted the existence of some connexion between the cargo of mummies and the sinister joseph curwen . his exotic studies and his curious chemical importations being common knowledge , and his fondness for graveyards being common suspicion ; it did not take much imagination to link him with a freakish importation which could not conceivably have been destined for anyone else in the town . as if conscious of this natural belief , curwen took care to speak casually on several occasions of the chemical value of the balsams found in mummies ; thinking perhaps that he might make the affair seem less unnatural , yet stopping just short of admitting his participation . weeden and smith , of course , felt no doubt whatsoever of the significance of the thing ; and indulged in the wildest theories concerning curwen and his monstrous labours .\\n\\nthe following spring , like that of the year before , had heavy rains ; and the watchers kept careful track of the river-bank behind the curwen farm . large sections were washed away , and a certain number of bones discovered ; but no glimpse was afforded of any actual subterranean chambers or burrows . something was rumoured , however , at the village of pawtuxet about a mile below , where the river flows in falls over a rocky terrace to join the placed landlocked cove . there , where quaint old cottages climbed the hill from the rustic bridge , and fishing-smacks lay anchored at their sleepy docks , a vague report went round of things that were floating down the river and flashing into sight for a minute as they went over the falls . of course the pawtuxet in a long river which winds through many settled regions abounding in graveyards , and of course the spring rains had been very heavy ; but the fisherfolk about the bridge did not like the wild way that one of the things stared as it shot down to the still waters below , or the way that another half cried out although its condition had greatly departed from that of objects which normally cried out . that rumour sent smith--for weeden was just then at sea--in haste to the river-bank behind the farm ; where surely enough there remained the evidence of an extensive cave-in . there was , however , no trace of a passage into the steep bank ; for the miniature avalanche had left behind a solid wall of mixed earth and shrubbery from aloft . smith went to the extent of some experimental digging , but was deterred by lack of success--or perhaps by fear of possible success . it is interesting to speculate on what the persistent and revengeful weeden would have done had he been ashore at the time .\\n\\n4\\n\\nby the autumn of 1770 weeden decided that the time was ripe to tell others of his discoveries ; for he had a large number of facts to link together , and a second eye-witness to refute the possible charge that jealousy and vindictiveness had spurred his fancy . as his first confidant he selected capt . james mathewson of the enterprise , who on the one hand knew him well enough not to doubt his veracity , and on the other hand was sufficiently influential in the town to be heard in turn with respect . the colloquy took place in an upper room of sabin\\'s tavern near the docks , with smith present to corroborate virtually every statement ; and it could be seen that capt . mathewson was tremendously impressed . like nearly everyone else in the town , he had had black suspicions of his own anent joseph curwen ; hence it needed only this confirmation and enlargement of data to convince him absolutely . at the end of the conference he was very grave , and enjoined strict silence upon the two younger men . he would , he said , transmit the information separately to some ten or so of the most learned and prominent citizens of providence ; ascertaining their views and following whatever advice they might have to offer . secrecy would probably be essential in any case , for this was no matter that the town constables or militia could cope with ; and above all else the excitable crowd must be kept in ignorance , lest there be enacted in these already troublous times a repetition of that frightful salem panic of less than a century before which had first brought curwen hither .\\n\\nthe right persons to tell , he believed , would be dr . benjamin west , whose pamphlet on the late transit of venus proved him a scholar and keen thinker ; rev . james manning , president of the college which had just moved up from warren and was temporarily housed in the new king street schoolhouse awaiting the completion of its building on the hill above presbyterian-lane ; ex-governor stephen hopkins , who had been a member of the philosophical society at newport , and was a man of very broad perceptions ; john carter , publisher of the gazette ; all four of the brown brothers , john , joseph , nicholas , and moses , who formed the recognised local magnates , and of whom joseph was an amateur scientist of parts ; old dr . jabez bowen , whose erudition was considerable , and who had much first-hand knowledge of curwen\\'s odd purchases ; and capt . abraham whipple , a privateersman of phenomenal boldness and energy who could be counted on to lead in any active measures needed . these men , if favourable , might eventually be brought together for collective deliberation ; and with them would rest the responsibility of deciding whether or not to inform the governor of the colony , joseph wanton of newport , before taking action .\\n\\nthe mission of capt . mathewson prospered beyond his highest expectations ; for whilst he found one or two of the chosen confidants somewhat sceptical of the possible ghastly side of weeden\\'s tale , there was not one who did not think it necessary to take some sort of secret and co\\xc3\\xb6rdinated action . curwen , it was clear , formed a vague potential menace to the welfare of the town and colony ; and must be eliminated at any cost . late in december 1770 a group of eminent townsmen met at the home of stephen hopkins and debated tentative measures . weeden\\'s notes , which he had given to capt . mathewson , were carefully read ; and he and smith were summoned to give testimony anent details . something very like fear seized the whole assemblage before the meeting was over , though there ran through that fear a grim determination which capt . whipple\\'s bluff and resonant profanity best expressed . they would not notify the governor , because a more than legal course seemed necessary . with hidden powers of uncertain extent apparently at his disposal , curwen was not a man who could safely be warned to leave town . nameless reprisals might ensue , and even if the sinister creature complied , the removal would be no more than the shifting of an unclean burden to another place . the times were lawless , and men who had flouted the king\\'s revenue forces for years were not the ones to balk at sterner things when duty impelled . curwen must be surprised at his pawtuxet farm by a large raiding-party of seasoned privateersmen and given one decisive chance to explain himself . if he proved a madman , amusing himself with shrieks and imaginary conversations in different voices , he would be properly confined . if something graver appeared , and if the underground horrors indeed turned out to be real , he and all with him must die . it could be done quietly , and even the widow and her father need not be told how it came about .\\n\\nwhile these serious steps were under discussion there occurred in the town an incident so terrible and inexplicable that for a time little else was mentioned for miles around . in the middle of a moon-light january night with heavy snow underfoot there resounded over the river and up the hill a shocking series of cries which brought sleepy heads to every window ; and people around weybosset point saw a great white thing plunging frantically along the badly cleared space in front of the turk\\'s head . there was a baying of dogs in the distance , but this subsided as soon as the clamour of the awakened town became audible . parties of men with lanterns and muskets hurried out to see what was happening , but nothing rewarded their search . the next morning , however , a giant , muscular body , stark naked , was found on the jams of ice around the southern piers of the great bridge , where the long dock stretched out beside abbott\\'s distil-house , and the identity of this object became a theme for endless speculation and whispering . it was not so much the younger as the older folk who whispered , for only in the patriarchs did that rigid face with horror-bulging eyes strike any chord of memory . they , shaking as they did so , exchanged furtive murmurs of wonder and fear ; for in those stiff , hideous features lay a resemblance so marvellous as to be almost an identity--and that identity was with a man who had died full fifty years before .\\n\\nezra weeden was present at the finding ; and remembering the baying of the night before , set out along weybosset street and across muddy dock bridge whence the sound had come . he had a curious expectancy , and was not surprised when , reaching the edge of the settled district where the street merged into the pawtuxet road , he came upon some very curious tracks in the snow . the naked giant had been pursued by dogs and many booted men , and the returning tracks of the hounds and their masters could be easily traced . they had given up the chase upon coming too near the town . weeden smiled grimly , and as a perfunctory detail traced the footprints back to their source . it was the pawtuxet farm of joseph curwen , as he well knew it would be ; and he would have given much had the yard been less confusingly trampled . as it was , he dared not seem too interested in full daylight . dr . bowen , to whom weeden went at once with his report , performed an autopsy on the strange corpse , and discovered peculiarities which baffled him utterly . the digestive tracts of the huge man seemed never to have been in use , whilst the whole skin had a coarse , loosely knit texture impossible to account for . impressed by what the old men whispered of this body\\'s likeness to the long-dead blacksmith daniel green , whose great-grandson aaron hoppin was a supercargo in curwen\\'s employ , weeden asked casual questions till he found where green was buried . that night a party of ten visited the old north burying ground opposite herrenden\\'s lane and opened a grave . they found it vacant , precisely as they had expected .\\n\\nmeanwhile arrangements had been made with the post riders to intercept joseph curwen\\'s mail , and shortly before the incident of the naked body there was found a letter from one jedediah orne of salem which made the co\\xc3\\xb6perating citizens think deeply . parts of it , copied and preserved in the private archives of the smith family where charles ward found it , ran as follows .\\n\\ni delight that you continue in ye gett\\'g at olde matters in your way , and doe not think better was done at mr . hutchinson\\'s in salem-village . certainely , there was noth\\'g but ye liveliest awfulness in that which h . rais\\'d upp from what he cou\\'d gather onlie a part of . what you sente , did not worke , whether because of any thing miss\\'g , or because ye wordes were not righte from my speak\\'g or yr copy\\'g . i alone am at a loss . i have not ye chymicall art to followe borellus , and owne my self confounded by ye vii . booke of ye necronomicon that you recommende . but i wou\\'d have you observe what was told to us aboute tak\\'g care whom to calle upp , for you are sensible what mr . mather writ in ye magnalia of-- , and can judge how truely that horrendous thing is reported . i say to you againe , doe not call up any that you can not put downe ; by the which i meane , any that can in turne call up somewhat against you , whereby your powerfullest devices may not be of use . ask of the lesser , lest the greater shal not wish to answer , and shal commande more than you . i was frighted when i read of your know\\'g what ben zariatnatmik hadde in his ebony boxe , for i was conscious who must have tolde you . and againe i ask that you shalle write me as jedediah and not simon . in this community a man may not live too long , and you knowe my plan by which i came back as my son . i am desirous you will acquaint me with what ye black man learnt from sylvanus cocidius in ye vault , under ye roman wall , and will be oblig\\'d for ye lend\\'g of ye ms . you speak of .\\n\\nanother and unsigned letter from philadelphia provoked equal thought , especially for the following passage :\\n\\ni will observe what you say respecting the sending of accounts only by yr vessels , but can not always be certain when to expect them . in the matter spoke of , i require onlie one more thing ; but wish to be sure i apprehend you exactly . you inform me , that no part must be missing if the finest effects are to be had , but you can not but know how hard it is to be sure . it seems a great hazard and burthen to take away the whole box , and in town (i .e . st . peter\\'s , st . paul\\'s , st . mary\\'s or christ church) it can scarce be done at all . but i know what imperfections were in the one i rais\\'d up october last , and how many live specimens you were forc\\'d to imploy before you hit upon the right mode in the year 1766 ; so will be guided by you in all matters . i am impatient for yr brig , and inquire daily at mr . biddle\\'s wharf .\\n\\na third suspicious letter was in an unknown tongue and even an unknown alphabet . in the smith diary found by charles ward a single oft-repeated combination of characters is clumsily copied ; and authorities at brown university have pronounced the alphabet amharic or abyssinian , although they do not recognise the word . none of these epistles was ever delivered to curwen , though the disappearance of jedediah orne from salem as recorded shortly afterward shewed that the providence men took certain quiet steps . the pennsylvania historical society also has some curious letters received by dr . shippen regarding the presence of an unwholesome character in philadelphia . but more decisive steps were in the air , and it is in the secret assemblages of sworn and tested sailors and faithful old privateersmen in the brown warehouses by night that we must look for the main fruits of weeden\\'s disclosures . slowly and surely a plan of campaign was under development which would leave no trace of joseph curwen\\'s noxious mysteries .\\n\\ncurwen , despite all precautions , apparently felt that something was in the wind ; for he was now remarked to wear an unusually worried look . his coach was seen at all hours in the town and on the pawtuxet road , and he dropped little by little the air of forced geniality with which he had latterly sought to combat the town\\'s prejudice . the nearest neighbours to his farm , the fenners , one night remarked a great shaft of light shooting into the sky from some aperture in the roof of that cryptical stone building with the high , excessively narrow windows ; an event which they quickly communicated to john brown in providence . mr . brown had become the executive leader of the select group bent on curwen\\'s extirpation , and had informed the fenners that some action was about to be taken . this he deemed needful because of the impossibility of their not witnessing the final raid ; and he explained his course by saying that curwen was known to be a spy of the customs officers at newport , against whom the hand of every providence skipper , merchant , and farmer was openly or clandestinely raised . whether the ruse was wholly believed by neighbours who had seen so many queer things is not certain ; but at any rate the fenners were willing to connect any evil with a man of such queer ways . to them mr . brown had entrusted the duty of watching the curwen farmhouse , and of regularly reporting every incident which took place there .\\n\\n5\\n\\nthe probability that curwen was on guard and attempting unusual things , as suggested by the odd shaft of light , precipitated at last the action so carefully devised by the band of serious citizens . according to the smith diary a company of about 100 men met at 10 p .m . on friday , april 12th , 1771 , in the great room of thurston\\'s tavern at the sign of the golden lion on weybosset point across the bridge . of the guiding group of prominent men in addition to the leader john brown there were present dr . bowen , with his case of surgical instruments , president manning without the great periwig (the largest in the colonies) for which he was noted , governor hopkins , wrapped in his dark cloak and accompanied by his seafaring brother esek , whom he had initiated at the last moment with the permission of the rest , john carter , capt . mathewson , and capt . whipple , who was to lead the actual raiding party . these chiefs conferred apart in a rear chamber , after which capt . whipple emerged to the great room and gave the gathered seamen their last oaths and instructions . eleazar smith was with the leaders as they sat in the rear apartment awaiting the arrival of ezra weeden , whose duty was to keep track of curwen and report the departure of his coach for the farm .\\n\\nabout 10 :30 a heavy rumble was heard on the great bridge , followed by the sound of a coach in the street outside ; and at that hour there was no need of waiting for weeden in order to know that the doomed man had set out for his last night of unhallowed wizardry . a moment later , as the receding coach clattered faintly over the muddy dock bridge , weeden appeared ; and the raiders fell silently into military order in the street , shouldering the firelocks , fowling-pieces , or whaling harpoons which they had with them . weeden and smith were with the party , and of the deliberating citizens there were present for active service capt . whipple , the leader , capt . esek hopkins , john carter , president manning , capt . mathewson , and dr . bowen ; together with moses brown , who had come up at the eleventh hour though absent from the preliminary session in the tavern . all these freemen and their hundred sailors began the long march without delay , grim and a trifle apprehensive as they left the muddy dock behind and mounted the gentle rise of broad street toward the pawtuxet road . just beyond elder snow\\'s church some of the men turned back to take a parting look at providence lying outspread under the early spring stars . steeples and gables rose dark and shapely , and salt breezes swept up gently from the cove north of the bridge . vega was climbing above the great hill across the water , whose crest of trees was broken by the roof-line of the unfinished college edifice . at the foot of that hill , and along the narrow mounting lanes of its side , the old town dreamed ; old providence , for whose safety and sanity so monstrous and colossal a blasphemy was about to be wiped out .\\n\\nan hour and a quarter later the raiders arrived , as previously agreed , at the fenner farmhouse ; where they heard a final report on their intended victim . he had reached his farm over half an hour before , and the strange light had soon afterward shot once more into the sky , but there were no lights in any visible windows . this was always the case of late . even as this news was given another great glare arose toward the south , and the party realised that they had indeed come close to the scene of awesome and unnatural wonders . capt . whipple now ordered his force to separate into three divisions ; one of twenty men under eleazar smith to strike across to the shore and guard the landing-place against possible reinforcements for curwen until summoned by a messenger for desperate service , a second of twenty men under capt . esek hopkins to steal down into the river valley behind the curwen farm and demolish with axes or gunpowder the oaken door in the high , steep bank , and the third to close in on the house and adjacent buildings themselves . of this division one third was to be led by capt . mathewson to the cryptical stone edifice with high narrow windows , another third to follow capt . whipple himself to the main farmhouse , and the remaining third to preserve a circle around the whole group of buildings until summoned by a final emergency signal .\\n\\nthe river party would break down the hillside door at the sound of a single whistle-blast , then wait and capture anything which might issue from the regions within . at the sound of two whistle-blasts it would advance through the aperture to oppose the enemy or join the rest of the raiding contingent . the party at the stone building would accept these respective signals in an analogous manner ; forcing an entrance at the first , and at the second descending whatever passage into the ground might be discovered , and joining the general or focal warfare expected to take place within the caverns . a third or emergency signal of three blasts would summon the immediate reserve from its general guard duty ; its twenty men dividing equally and entering the unknown depths through both farmhouse and stone building . capt . whipple\\'s belief in the existence of catacombs was absolute , and he took no alternative into consideration when making his plans . he had with him a whistle of great power and shrillness , and did not fear any upsetting or misunderstanding of signals . the final reserve at the landing , of course , was nearly out of the whistle\\'s range ; hence would require a special messenger if needed for help . moses brown and john carter went with capt . hopkins to the river-bank , while president manning was detailed with capt . mathewson to the stone building . dr . bowen , with ezra weeden , remained in capt . whipple\\'s party which was to storm the farmhouse itself . the attack was to begin as soon as a messenger from capt . hopkins had joined capt . whipple to notify him of the river party\\'s readiness . the leader would then deliver the loud single blast , and the various advance parties would commence their simultaneous attack on three points . shortly before 1 a .m . the three divisions left the fenner farmhouse ; one to guard the landing , another to seek the river valley and the hillside door , and the third to subdivide and attend to the actual buildings of the curwen farm .\\n\\neleazar smith , who accompanied the shore-guarding party , records in his diary an uneventful march and a long wait on the bluff by the bay ; broken once by what seemed to be the distant sound of the signal whistle and again by a peculiar muffled blend of roaring and crying and a powder blast which seemed to come from the same direction . later on one man thought he caught some distant gunshots , and still later smith himself felt the throb of titanic and thunderous words resounding in upper air . it was just before dawn that a single haggard messenger with wild eyes and a hideous unknown odour about his clothing appeared and told the detachment to disperse quietly to their homes and never again think or speak of the night\\'s doings or of him who had been joseph curwen . something about the bearing of the messenger carried a conviction which his mere words could never have conveyed ; for though he was a seaman well known to many of them , there was something obscurely lost or gained in his soul which set him for evermore apart . it was the same later on when they met other old companions who had gone into that zone of horror . most of them had lost or gained something imponderable and indescribable . they had seen or heard or felt something which was not for human creatures , and could not forget it . from them there was never any gossip , for to even the commonest of mortal instincts there are terrible boundaries . and from that single messenger the party at the shore caught a nameless awe which almost sealed their own lips . very few are the rumours which ever came from any of them , and eleazar smith\\'s diary is the only written record which has survived from that whole expedition which set forth from the sign of the golden lion under the stars .\\n\\ncharles ward , however , discovered another vague sidelight in some fenner correspondence which he found in new london , where he knew another branch of the family had lived . it seems that the fenners , from whose house the doomed farm was distantly visible , had watched the departing columns of raiders ; and had heard very clearly the angry barking of the curwen dogs , followed by the first shrill blast which precipitated the attack . this blast had been followed by a repetition of the great shaft of light from the stone building , and in another moment , after a quick sounding of the second signal ordering a general invasion , there had come a subdued prattle of musketry followed by a horrible roaring cry which the correspondent luke fenner had represented in his epistle by the characters \\'waaaahrrrrr-r\\'waaahrrr .\\'\\n\\nthis cry , however , had possessed a quality which no mere writing could convey , and the correspondent mentions that his mother fainted completely at the sound . it was later repeated less loudly , and further but more muffled evidences of gunfire ensued ; together with a loud explosion of powder from the direction of the river . about an hour afterward all the dogs began to bark frightfully , and there were vague ground rumblings so marked that the candlesticks tottered on the mantelpiece . a strong smell of sulphur was noted ; and luke fenner\\'s father declared that he heard the third or emergency whistle signal , though the others failed to detect it . muffled musketry sounded again , followed by a deep scream less piercing but even more horrible than those which had preceded it ; a kind of throaty , nastily plastic cough or gurgle whose quality as a scream must have come more from its continuity and psychological import than from its actual acoustic value .\\n\\nthen the flaming thing burst into sight at a point where the curwen farm ought to lie , and the human cries of desperate and frightened men were heard . muskets flashed and cracked , and the flaming thing fell to the ground . a second flaming thing appeared , and a shriek of human origin was plainly distinguished . fenner wrote that he could even gather a few words belched in frenzy : almighty , protect thy lamb ! then there were more shots , and the second flaming thing fell . after that came silence for about three-quarters of an hour ; at the end of which time little arthur fenner , luke\\'s brother , exclaimed that he saw \"a red fog\" going up to the stars from the accursed farm in the distance . no one but the child can testify to this , but luke admits the significant coincidence implied by the panic of almost convulsive fright which at the same moment arched the backs and stiffened the fur of the three cats then within the room .\\n\\nfive minutes later a chill wind blew up , and the air became suffused with an intolerable stench that only the strong freshness of the sea could have prevented its being notice by the shore party or by any wakeful souls in the pawtuxet village . this stench was nothing which any of the fenners had ever encountered before , and produced a kind of clutching , amorphous fear beyond that of the tomb or the charnel-house . close upon it came the awful voice which no hapless hearer will ever be able to forget . it thundered out of the sky like a doom , and windows rattled as its echoes died away . it was deep and musical ; powerful as a bass organ , but evil as the forbidden books of the arabs . what it said no man can tell , for it spoke in an unknown tongue , but this is the writing luke fenner set down to portray the daemoniac intonations : \\'deesmees jeshet bone dosefe duvema enitemoss .\\' not till the year 1919 did any soul link this crude transcript with anything else in mortal knowledge , but charles ward paled as he recognised what mirandola had denounced in shudders as the ultimate horror among black magic\\'s incantations .\\n\\nan unmistakable human shout or deep chorused scream seemed to answer this malign wonder from the curwen farm , after which the unknown stench grew complex with an added odour equally intolerable . a wailing distinctly different from the scream now burst out , and was protracted ululantly in rising and falling paroxysms . at times it became almost articulate , though no auditor could trace any definite words ; and at one point it seemed to verge toward the confines of diabolic and hysterical laughter . then a yell of utter , ultimate fright and stark madness wrenched from scores of human throats--a yell which came strong and clear despite the depth from which it must have burst ; after which darkness and silence ruled all things . spirals of acrid smoke ascended to blot out the stars , though no flames appeared and no buildings were observed to be gone or injured on the following day .\\n\\ntoward dawn two frightened messengers with monstrous and unplaceable odours saturating their clothing knocked at the fenner door and requested a keg of rum , for which they paid very well indeed . one of them told the family that the affair of joseph curwen was over , and that the events of the night were not to be mentioned again . arrogant as the order seemed , the aspect of him who gave it took away all resentment and lent it a fearsome authority ; so that only these furtive letters of luke fenner , which he urged his connecticut relative to destroy , remain to tell what was seen and heard . the non-compliance of that relative , whereby the letters were saved after all , has alone kept the matter from a merciful oblivion . charles ward had one detail to add as a result of a long canvass of pawtuxet residents for ancestral traditions . old charles slocum of that village said that there was known to his grandfather a queer rumour concerning a charred , distorted body found in the fields a week after the death of joseph curwen was announced . what kept the talk alive was the notion that this body , so far as could be seen in its burnt and twisted condition , was neither thoroughly human nor wholly allied to any animal which pawtuxet folk had ever seen or read about .\\n\\n6\\n\\nnot one man who participated in that terrible raid could ever be induced to say a word concerning it , and every fragment of the vague data which survives comes from those outside the final fighting party . there is something frightful in the care with which these actual raiders destroyed each scrap which bore the least allusion to the matter . eight sailors had been killed , but although their bodies were not produced their families were satisfied with the statement that a clash with customs officers had occurred . the same statement also covered the numerous cases of wounds , all of which were extensively bandaged and treated only by dr . jabez bowen , who had accompanied the party . hardest to explain was the nameless odour clinging to all the raiders , a thing which was discussed for weeks . of the citizen leaders , capt . whipple and moses brown were most severely hurt , and letters of their wives testify the bewilderment which their reticence and close guarding of their bandages produced . psychologically every participant was aged , sobered , and shaken . it is fortunate that they were all strong men of action and simple , orthodox religionists , for with more subtle introspectiveness and mental complexity they would have fared ill indeed . president manning was the most disturbed ; but even he outgrew the darkest shadow , and smothered memories in prayers . every man of those leaders had a stirring part to play in later years , and it is perhaps fortunate that this is so . little more than a twelvemonth afterward capt . whipple led the mob who burnt the revenue ship gaspee , and in this bold act we may trace one step in the blotting out of unwholesome images .\\n\\nthere was delivered to the widow of joseph curwen a sealed leaden coffin of curious design , obviously found ready on the spot when needed , in which she was told her husband\\'s body lay . he had , it was explained , been killed in a customs battle about which it was not politic to give details . more than this no tongue ever uttered of joseph curwen\\'s end , and charles ward had only a single hint wherewith to construct a theory . this hint was the merest thread--a shaky underscoring of a passage in jedediah orne\\'s confiscated letter to curwen , as partly copied in ezra weeden\\'s handwriting . the copy was found in the possession of smith\\'s descendants ; and we are left to decide whether weeden gave it to his companion after the end , as a mute clue to the abnormality which had occurred , or whether , as is more probable , smith had it before , and added the underscoring himself from what he had managed to extract from his friend by shrewd guessing and adroit cross-questioning . the underlined passage is merely this :\\n\\ni say to you againe , doe not call up any that you can not put downe ; by the which i meane , any that can in turne call up somewhat against you , whereby your powerfullest devices may not be of use . ask of the lesser , lest the greater shal not wish to answer , and shal commande more than you .\\n\\nin the light of this passage , and reflecting on what last unmentionable allies a beaten man might try to summon in his direst extremity , charles ward may well have wondered whether any citizen of providence killed joseph curwen .\\n\\nthe deliberate effacement of every memory of the dead man from providence life and annals was vastly aided by the influence of the raiding leaders . they had not at first meant to be so thorough , and had allowed the widow and her father and child to remain in ignorance of the true conditions ; but capt . tillinghast was an astute man , and soon uncovered enough rumours to whet his horror and cause him to demand that the daughter and granddaughter change their name , burn the library and all remaining papers , and chisel the inscription from the slate slab above joseph curwen\\'s grave . he knew capt . whipple well , and probably extracted more hints from that bluff mariner and anyone else ever gained repecting the end of the accursed sorcerer .\\n\\nfrom that time on the obliteration of curwen\\'s memory became increasingly rigid , extending at last by common consent even to the town records and files of the gazette . it can be compared in spirit only to the hush that lay on oscar wilde\\'s name for a decade after his disgrace , and in extent only to the fate of that sinful king of runazar in lord dunsany\\'s tale , whom the gods decided must not only cease to be , but must cease ever to have been .\\n\\nmrs . tillinghast , as the widow became known after 1772 , sold the house in olney court and resided with her father in power\\'s lane till her death in 1817 . the farm at pawtuxet , shunned by every living soul , remained to moulder through the years ; and seemed to decay with unaccountable rapidity . by 1780 only the stone and brickwork were standing , and by 1800 even these had fallen to shapeless heaps . none ventured to pierce the tangled shrubbery on the river-bank behind which the hillside door may have lain , nor did any try to frame a definite image of the scenes amidst which joseph curwen departed from the horrors he had wrought .\\n\\nonly robust old capt . whipple was heard by alert listeners to mutter once in a while to himself , \"pox on that---- , but he had no business to laugh while he screamed . \\'twas as though the damn\\'d----had some\\'at up his sleeve . for half a crown i\\'d burn his----home .\"\\n\\niii . a search and an evocation\\n\\n1\\n\\ncharles ward , as we have seen , first learned in 1918 of his descent from joseph curwen . that he at once took an intense interest in everything pertaining to the bygone mystery is not to be wondered at ; for every vague rumour that he had heard of curwen now became something vital to himself , in whom flowed curwen\\'s blood . no spirited and imaginative genealogist could have done otherwise than begin forthwith an avid and systematic collection of curwen data .\\n\\nin his first delvings there was not the slightest attempt at secrecy ; so that even dr . lyman hesitates to date the youth\\'s madness from any period before the close of 1919 . he talked freely with his family--though his mother was not particularly pleased to own an ancestor like curwen--and with the officials of the various museums and libraries he visited . in applying to private families for records thought to be in their possession he made no concealment of his object , and shared the somewhat amused scepticism with which the accounts of the old diarists and letter-writers were regarded . he often expressed a keen wonder as to what really had taken place a century and a half before at the pawtuxet farmhouse whose site he vainly tried to find , and what joseph curwen really had been .\\n\\nwhen he came across the smith diary and archives and encountered the letter from jedediah orne he decided to visit salem and look up curwen\\'s early activities and connexions there , which he did during the easter vacation of 1919 . at the essex institute , which was well known to him from former sojourns in the glamorous old town of crumbling puritan gables and clustered gambrel roofs , he was very kindly received , and unearthed there a considerable amount of curwen data . he found that his ancestor was born in salem-village , now danvers , seven miles from town , on the eighteenth of february (o .s .) 1662-3 ; and that he had run away to sea at the age of fifteen , not appearing again for nine years , when he returned with the speech , dress , and manners of a native englishman and settled in salem proper . at that time he had little to do with his family , but spent most of his hours with the curious books he had brought from europe , and the strange chemicals which came for him on ships from england , france , and holland . certain trips of his into the country were the objects of much local inquisitiveness , and were whisperingly associated with vague rumours of fires on the hills at night .\\n\\ncurwen\\'s only close friends had been one edward hutchinson of salem-village and one simon orne of salem . with these men he was often seen in conference about the common , and visits among them were by no means infrequent . hutchinson had a house well out toward the woods , and it was not altogether liked by sensitive people because of the sounds heard there at night . he was said to entertain strange visitors , and the lights seen from his windows were not always of the same colour . the knowledge he displayed concerning long-dead persons and long-forgotten events was considered distinctly unwholesome , and he disappeared about the time the witchcraft panic began , never to be heard from again . at that time joseph curwen also departed , but his settlement in providence was soon learned of . simon orne lived in salem until 1720 , when his failure to grow visibly old began to excite attention . he thereafter disappeared , though thirty years later his precise counterpart and self-styled son turned up to claim his property . the claim was allowed on the strength of documents in simon orne\\'s known hand , and jedediah orne continued to dwell in salem till 1771 , when certain letters from providence citizens to the rev . thomas barnard and others brought about his quiet removal to parts unknown .\\n\\ncertain documents by and about all of the strange characters were available at the essex institute , the court house , and the registry of deeds , and included both harmless commonplaces such as land titles and bills of sale , and furtive fragments of a more provocative nature . there were four or five unmistakable allusions to them on the witchcraft trial records ; as when one hepzibah lawson swore on july 10 , 1692 , at the court of oyer and terminer under judge hathorne , that : \\'fortie witches and the blacke man were wont to meete in the woodes behind mr . hutchinson\\'s house\\' , and one amity how declared at a session of august 8th before judge gedney that : \\'mr . g . b . (rev . george burroughs) on that nighte putt ye divell his marke upon bridget s . , jonathan a . , simon o . , deliverance w . , joseph c . , susan p . , mehitable c . , and deborah b .\\'\\n\\nthen there was a catalogue of hutchinson\\'s uncanny library as found after his disappearance , and an unfinished manuscript in his handwriting , couched in a cipher none could read . ward had a photostatic copy of this manuscript made , and began to work casually on the cipher as soon as it was delivered to him . after the following august his labours on the cipher became intense and feverish , and there is reason to believe from his speech and conduct that he hit upon the key before october or november . he never stated , though , whether or not he had succeeded .\\n\\nbut of greatest immediate interest was the orne material . it took ward only a short time to prove from identity of penmanship a thing he had already considered established from the text of the letter to curwen ; namely , that simon orne and his supposed son were one and the same person . as orne had said to his correspondent , it was hardly safe to live too long in salem , hence he resorted to a thirty-year sojourn abroad , and did not return to claim his lands except as a representative of a new generation . orne had apparently been careful to destroy most of his correspondence , but the citizens who took action in 1771 found and preserved a few letters and papers which excited their wonder . there were cryptic formulae and diagrams in his and other hands which ward now either copied with care or had photographed , and one extremely mysterious letter in a chirography that the searcher recognised from items in the registry of deeds as positively joseph curwen\\'s .\\n\\nthis curwen letter , though undated as to the year , was evidently not the one in answer to which orne had written the confiscated missive ; and from internal evidence ward placed it not much later than 1750 . it may not be amiss to give the text in full , as a sample of the style of one whose history was so dark and terrible . the recipient is addressed as \"simon\" , but a line (whether drawn by curwen or orne ward could not tell) is run through the word .\\n\\nprovidence , 1 . may\\n\\nbrother :-\\n\\nmy honour\\'d antient friende , due respects and earnest wishes to him whom we serue for yr eternall power . i am just come upon that which you ought to knowe , concern\\'g the matter of the laste extremitie and what to doe regard\\'g yt . i am not dispos\\'d to followe you in go\\'g away on acct . of my yeares , for prouidence hath not ye sharpeness of ye bay in hunt\\'g oute uncommon things and bringinge to tryall . i am ty\\'d up in shippes and goodes , and cou\\'d not doe as you did , besides the whiche my farme at patuxet hath under it what you knowe , and wou\\'d not waite for my com\\'g backe as an other .\\n\\nbut i am unreadie for harde fortunes , as i haue tolde you , and haue longe work\\'d upon ye way of get\\'g backe after ye laste . i laste night strucke on ye wordes that bringe up yogge-sothothe , and sawe for ye first time that face spoke of by ibn schacabao in ye---- . and it said , that ye iii psalme in ye liber-damnatus holdes ye clauicle . with sunne in v house , saturne in trine , drawe ye pentagram of fire , and saye ye ninth uerse thrice . this uerse repeate eache roodemas and hallow\\'s eue ;

for none of the records encountered up to that time had been at all specific . the discovery was doubly striking because it indicated as the newer curwen house , built in 1761 on the site of the old , a dilapidated building still standing in olney court and well known to ward in his antiquarian rambles over stampers\\' hill . the place was indeed only a few squares from his own home on the great hill\\'s higher ground , and was now the abode of a negro family much esteemed for occasional washing , housecleaning , and furnace-tending services . to find , in distant salem , such sudden proof of the significance of this familiar rookery in his own family history , was a highly impressive thing to ward ; and he resolved to explore the place immediately upon his return . the more mystical phases of the letter , which he took to be some extravagant kind of symbolism , frankly baffled him ; though he noted with a thrill of curiousity that the biblical passage referred to--job 14 ,14--was the familiar verse , \\'if a man die , shall he live again ? all the days of my appointed time will i wait , until my change come .\\'\\n\\n2\\n\\nyoung ward came home in a state of pleasant excitement , and spent the following saturday in a long and exhaustive study of the house in olney court . the place , now crumbling with age , had never been a mansion ; but was a modest two-and-a-half story wooden town house of the familiar providence colonial type , with plain peaked roof , large central chimney , and artistically carved doorway with rayed fanlight , triangular pediment , and trim doric pilasters . it had suffered but little alteration externally , and ward felt he was gazing on something very close to the sinister matters of his quest .\\n\\nthe present negro inhabitants were known to him , and he was very courteously shewn about the interior by old asa and his stout wife hannah . here there was more change than the outside indicated , and ward saw with regret that fully half of the fine scroll-and-urn overmantels and shell-carved cupboard linings were gone , whilst most of the fine wainscotting and bolection moulding was marked , hacked , and gouged , or covered up altogether with cheap wall-paper . in general , the survey did not yield as much as ward had somehow expected ; but it was at least exciting to stand within the ancestral walls which had housed such a man of horror as joseph curwen . he saw with a thrill that a monogram had been very carefully effaced from the ancient brass knocker .\\n\\nfrom then until after the close of school ward spent his time on the photostatic copy of the hutchinson cipher and the accumulation of local curwen data . the former still proved unyielding ; but of the latter he obtained so much , and so many clues to similar data elsewhere , that he was ready by july to make a trip to new london and new york to consult old letters whose presence in those places was indicated . this trip was very fruitful , for it brought him the fenner letters with their terrible description of the pawtuxet farmhouse raid , and the nightingale-talbot letters in which he learned of the portrait painted on a panel of the curwen library . this matter of the portrait interested him particularly , since he would have given much to know just what joseph curwen looked like ; and he decided to make a second search of the house in olney court to see if there might not be some trace of the ancient features beneath peeling coats of later paint or layers of mouldy wall-paper .\\n\\nearly in august that search took place , and ward went carefully over the walls of every room sizeable enough to have been by any possibility the library of the evil builder . he paid especial attention to the large panels of such overmantels as still remained ; and was keenly excited after about an hour , when on a broad area above the fireplace in a spacious ground-floor room he became certain that the surface brought out by the peeling of several coats of paint was sensibly darker than any ordinary interior paint or the wood beneath it was likely to have been . a few more careful tests with a thin knife , and he knew that he had come upon an oil portrait of great extent . with truly scholarly restraint the youth did not risk the damage which an immediate attempt to uncover the hidden picture with the knife might have been , but just retired from the scene of his discovery to enlist expert help . in three days he returned with an artist of long experience , mr . walter c . dwight , whose studio is near the foot of college hill ; and that accomplished restorer of paintings set to work at once with proper methods and chemical substances . old asa and his wife were duly excited over their strange visitors , and were properly reimbursed for this invasion of their domestic hearth .\\n\\nas day by the day the work of restoration progressed , charles ward looked on with growing interest at the lines and shades gradually unveiled after their long oblivion . dwight had begun at the bottom ; hence since the picture was a three-quarter-length one , the face did not come out for some time . it was meanwhile seen that the subject was a spare , well-shaped man with dark-blue coat , embroidered waistcoat , black satin small-clothes , and white silk stockings , seated in a carved chair against the background of a window with wharves and ships beyond . when the head came out it was observed to bear a neat albemarle wig , and to possess a thin , calm , undistinguished face which seemed somehow familiar to both ward and the artist . only at the very last , though , did the restorer and his client begin to grasp with astonishment at the details of that lean , pallid visage , and to recognise with a touch of awe the dramatic trick which heredity had played . for it took the final bath of oil and the final stroke of the delicate scraper to bring out fully the expression which centuries had hidden ; and to confront the bewildered charles dexter ward , dweller in the past , with his own living features in the countenance of his horrible great-great-great-grandfather .\\n\\nward brought his parents to see the marvel he had uncovered , and his father at once determined to purchase the picture despite its execution on stationary panelling . the resemblance to the boy , despite an appearance of rather great age , was marvellous ; and it could be seen that through some trick of atavism the physical contours of joseph curwen had found precise duplication after a century and a half . mrs . ward\\'s resemblance to her ancestor was not at all marked , though she could recall relatives who had some of the facial characteristics shared by her son and by the bygone curwen . she did not relish the discovery , and told her husband that he had better burn the picture instead of bringing it home . there was , she averred , something unwholesome about it ; not only intrinsically , but in its very resemblance to charles . mr . ward , however , was a practical man of power and affairs--a cotton manufacturer with extensive mills at riverpoint in the pawtuxet valley--and not one to listen to feminine scruples . the picture impressed him mightily with its likeness to his son , and he believed the boy deserved it as a present . in this opinion , it is needless to say , charles most heartily concurred ; and a few days later mr . ward located the owner of the house--a small rodent-featured person with a guttural accent--and obtained the whole mantel and overmantel bearing the picture at a curtly fixed price which cut short the impending torrent of unctuous haggling .\\n\\nit now remained to take off the panelling and remove it to the ward home , where provisions were made for its thorough restoration and installation with an electric mock-fireplace in charles\\'s third-floor study or library . to charles was left the task of superintending this removal , and on the twenty-eighth of august he accompanied two expert workmen from the crooker decorating firm to the house in olney court , where the mantel and portrait-bearing overmantel were detached with great care and precision for transportation in the company\\'s motor truck . there was left a space of exposed brickwork marking the chimney\\'s course , and in this young ward observed a cubical recess about a foot square , which must have lain directly behind the head of the portrait . curious as to what such a space might mean or contain , the youth approached and looked within ; finding beneath the deep coatings of dust and soot some loose yellowed papers , a crude , thick copybook , and a few mouldering textile shreds which may have formed the ribbon binding the rest together . blowing away the bulk of the dirt and cinders , he took up the book and looked at the bold inscription on its cover . it was in a hand which he had learned to recognise at the essex institute , and proclaimed the volume as the \\'journall and notes of jos : curwen , gent . of prouidence-plantations , late of salem .\\'\\n\\nexcited beyond measure by his discovery , ward shewed the book to the two curious workmen beside him . their testimony is absolute as to the nature and genuineness of the finding , and dr . willett relies on them to help establish his theory that the youth was not mad when he began his major eccentricities . all the other papers were likewise in curwen\\'s handwriting , and one of them seemed especially portentous because of its inscription : \\'to him who shal come after , & how he may gett beyonde time & ye spheres .\\'\\n\\nanother was in a cipher ; the same , ward hoped , as the hutchinson cipher which had hitherto baffled him . a third , and here the searcher rejoiced , seemed to be a key to the cipher ; whilst the fourth and fifth were addressed respectively to : \\'edw : hutchinson , armiger\\' and \\'jedediah orne , esq .\\' , \\'or their heir or heirs , or those represent\\'g them .\\' the sixth and last was inscribed : \\'joseph curwen his life and travells bet\\'n ye yeares 1678 and 1687 : of whither he voyag\\'d , where he stay\\'d , whom he sawe , and what he learnt .\\'\\n\\n3\\n\\nwe have now reached the point from which the more academic school of alienists date charles ward\\'s madness . upon his discovery the youth had looked immediately at a few of the inner pages of the book and manuscripts , and had evidently seen something which impressed him tremendously . indeed , in shewing the titles to the workmen , he appeared to guard the text itself with peculiar care , and to labour under a perturbation for which even the antiquarian and genealogical significance of the find could hardly account . upon returning home he broke the news with an almost embarrassed air , as if he wished to convey an idea of its supreme importance without having to exhibit the evidence itself . he did not even shew the titles to his parents , but simply told them that he had found some documents in joseph curwen\\'s handwriting , \\'mostly in cipher\\' , which would have to be studied very carefully before yielding up their true meaning . it is unlikely that he would have shewn what he did to the workmen , had it not been for their unconcealed curiousity . as it was he doubtless wished to avoid any display of peculiar reticence which would increase their discussion of the matter .\\n\\nthat night charles ward sat up in his room reading the new-found book and papers , and when day came he did not desist . his meals , on his urgent request when his mother called to see what was amiss , were sent up to him ; and in the afternoon he appeared only briefly when the men came to install the curwen picture and mantelpiece in his study . the next night he slept in snatches in his clothes , meanwhile wrestling feverishly with the unravelling of the cipher manuscript . in the morning his mother saw that he was at work on the photostatic copy of the hutchinson cipher , which he had frequently shewn her before ; but in response to her query he said that the curwen key could not be applied to it . that afternoon he abandoned his work and watched the men fascinatedly as they finished their installation of the picture with its woodwork above a cleverly realistic electric log , setting the mock-fireplace and overmantel a little out from the north wall as if a chimney existed , and boxing in the sides with panelling to match the room\\'s . the front panel holding the picture was sawn and hinged to allow cupboard space behind it . after the workmen went he moved his work into the study and sat down before it with his eyes half on the cipher and half on the portrait which stared back at him like a year-adding and century-recalling mirror .\\n\\nhis parents , subsequently recalling his conduct at this period , give interesting details anent the policy of concealment which he practised . before servants he seldom hid any paper which he might by studying , since he rightly assumed that curwen\\'s intricate and archaic chirography would be too much for them . with his parents , however , he was more circumspect ; and unless the manuscript in question were a cipher , or a mere mass of cryptic symbols and unknown ideographs (as that entitled \\'to him who shal come after , etc .\\' seemed to be) , he would cover it with some convenient paper until his caller had departed . at night he kept the papers under lock and key in an antique cabinet of his , where he also placed them whenever he left the room . he soon resumed fairly regular hours and habits , except that his long walks and other outside interests seemed to cease . the opening of school , where he now began his senior year , seemed a great bore to him ; and he frequently asserted his determination never to bother with college . he had , he said , important special investigations to make , which would provide him with more avenues toward knowledge and the humanities than any university which the world could boast .\\n\\nnaturally , only one who had always been more or less studious , eccentric , and solitary could have pursued this course for many days without attracting notice . ward , however , was constitutionally a scholar and a hermit ; hence his parents were less surprised than regretful at the close confinement and secrecy he adopted . at the same time , both his father and mother thought it odd that he would shew them no scrap of his treasure-trove , nor give any connected account of such data as he had deciphered . this reticence he explained away as due to a wish to wait until he might announce some connected revelation , but as the weeks passed without further disclosures there began to grow up between the youth and his family a kind of constraint ; intensified in his mother\\'s case by her manifest disapproval of all curwen delvings .\\n\\nduring october ward began visiting the libraries again , but no longer for the antiquarian matter of his former days . witchcraft and magic , occultism and daemonology , were what he sought now ; and when providence sources proved unfruitful he would take the train for boston and tap the wealth of the great library in copley square , the widener library at harvard , or the zion research library in brookline , where certain rare works on biblical subjects are available . he bought extensively , and fitted up a whole additional set of shelves in his study for newly acquired works on uncanny subjects ; while during the christmas holidays he made a round of out-of-town trips including one to salem to consult certain records at the essex institute .\\n\\nabout the middle of january , 1920 , there entered ward\\'s bearing an element of triumph which he did not explain , and he was no more found at work upon the hutchinson cipher . instead , he inaugurated a dual policy of chemical research and record-scanning ; fitting up for the one a laboratory in the unused attic of the house , and for the latter haunting all the sources of vital statistics in providence . local dealers in drugs and scientific supplies , later questioned , gave astonishingly queer and meaningless catalogues of the substances and instruments he purchased ; but clerks at the state house , the city hall , and the various libraries agree as to the definite object of his second interest . he was searching intensely and feverishly for the grave of joseph curwen , from whose slate slab an older generation had so wisely blotted the name .\\n\\nlittle by little there grew upon the ward family the conviction that something was wrong . charles had had freaks and changes of minor interests before , but this growing secrecy and absorption in strange pursuits was unlike even him . his school work was the merest pretence ; and although he failed in no test , it could be seen that the older application had all vanished . he had other concernments now ; and when not in his new laboratory with a score of obsolete alchemical books , could be found either poring over old burial records down town or glued to his volumes of occult lore in his study , where the startlingly--one almost fancied increasingly--similar features of joseph curwen stared blandly at him from the great overmantel on the north wall .\\n\\nlate in march ward added to his archive-searching a ghoulish series of rambles about the various ancient cemeteries of the city . the cause appeared later , when it was learned from city hall clerks that he had probably found an important clue . his quest had suddenly shifted from the grave of joseph curwen to that of one naphthali field ; and this shift was explained when , upon going over the files that he had been over , the investigators actually found a fragmentary record of curwen\\'s burial which had escaped the general obliteration , and which stated that the curious leaden coffin had been interred \\'10 ft . s . and 5 ft . w . of naphthali field\\'s grave in y- .\\' the lack of a specified burying-ground in the surviving entry greatly complicated the search , and naphthali field\\'s grave seemed as elusive as that of curwen ; but here no systematic effacement had existed , and one might reasonably be expected to stumble on the stone itself even if its record had perished . hence the rambles--from which st . john\\'s (the former king\\'s) churchyard and the ancient congregational burying-ground in the midst of swan point cemetery were excluded , since other statistics had shewn that the only naphthali field (obiit 1729) whose grave could have been meant had been a baptist .\\n\\n4\\n\\nit was toward may when dr . willett , at the request of the senior ward , and fortified with all the curwen data which the family had gleaned from charles in his non-secretive days , talked with the young man . the interview was of little value or conclusiveness , for willett felt at every moment that charles was thorough master of himself and in touch with matters of real importance ; but it at least force the secretive youth to offer some rational explanation of his recent demeanour . of a pallid , impassive type not easily shewing embarrassment , ward seemed quite ready to discuss his pursuits , though not to reveal their object . he stated that the papers of his ancestor had contained some remarkable secrets of early scientific knowledge , for the most part in cipher , of an apparent scope comparable only to the discoveries of friar bacon and perhaps surpassing even those . they were , however , meaningless except when correlated with a body of learning now wholly obsolete ; so that their immediate presentation to a world equipped only with modern science would rob them of all impressiveness and dramatic significance . to take their vivid place in the history of human thought they must first be correlated by one familiar with the background out of which they evolved , and to this task of correlation ward was now devoting himself . he was seeking to acquire as fast as possible those neglected arts of old which a true interpreter of the curwen data must possess , and hoped in time to made a full announcement and presentation of the utmost interest to mankind and to the world of thought . not even einstein , he declared , could more profoundly revolutionise the current conception of things .\\n\\nas to his graveyard search , whose object he freely admitted , but the details of whose progress he did not relate , he said he had reason to think that joseph curwen\\'s mutilated headstone bore certain mystic symbols--carved from directions in his will and ignorantly spared by those who had effaced the name--which were absolutely essential to the final solution of his cryptic system . curwen , he believed , had wish to guard his secret with care ; and had consequently distributed the data in an exceedingly curious fashion . when dr . willett asked to see the mystic documents , ward displayed much reluctance and tried to put him off with such things as photostatic copies of the hutchinson cipher and orne formulae and diagrams ; but finally shewed him the exteriors of some of the real curwen finds--the \\'journall and notes\\' , the cipher (title in cipher also) , and the formula-filled message \\'to him who shal come after\\'--and let him glance inside such as were in obscure characters .\\n\\nhe also opened the diary at a page carefully selected for its innocuousness and gave willett a glimpse of curwen\\'s connected handwriting in english . the doctor noted very closely the crabbed and complicated letters , and the general aura of the seventeenth century which clung round both penmanship and style despite the writer\\'s survival into the eighteenth century , and became quickly certain that the document was genuine . the text itself was relatively trivial , and willett recalled only a fragment :\\n\\n\\'wedn . 16 octr . 1754 . my sloope the wakeful this day putt in from london with xx newe men pick\\'d up in ye indies , spaniards from martineco and 2 dutch men from surinam . ye dutch men are like to desert from have\\'g hearde somewhat ill of these ventures , but i will see to ye inducing of them to staye . for mr . knight dexter of ye bay and book 120 pieces camblets , 100 pieces assrtd . cambleteens , 20 pieces blue duffles , 100 pieces shalloons , 50 pieces calamancoes , 300 pieces each , shendsoy and humhums . for mr . green at ye elephant 50 gallon cyttles , 20 warm\\'g pannes , 15 bake cyttles , 10 pr . smoke\\'g tonges . for mr . perrigo 1 sett of awles . for mr . nightingale 50 reames prime foolscap . say\\'d ye sabaoth thrice last nighte but none appear\\'d . i must heare more from mr . h . in transylvania , tho\\' it is harde reach\\'g him and exceeding strange he can not give me the use of what he hath so well us\\'d these hundred yeares . simon hath not writ these v . weekes , but i expecte soon hear\\'g from him .\\'\\n\\nwhen upon reaching this point dr . willett turned the leaf he was quickly checked by ward , who almost snatched the book from his grasp . all that the doctor had a chance to see on the newly opened page was a brief pair of sentences ; but these , strangely enough , lingered tenacious in his memory . they ran : \\'ye verse from liber-damnatus be\\'g spoke v roodmasses and iv hallows-eves , i am hopeful ye thing is breed\\'g outside ye spheres . it will drawe one who is to come , if i can make sure he shal bee , and he shal think on past thinges and look back thro\\' all ye yeares , against ye which i must have ready ye saltes or that to make \\'em with .\\'\\n\\nwillett saw no more , but somehow this small glimpse gave a new and vague terror to the painted features of joseph curwen which stared blandly down from the overmantel . even after that he entertained the odd fancy--which his medical skill of course assured him was only a fancy--that the eyes of the portrait had a sort of wish , if not an actual tendency , to follow young charles ward as he move about the room . he stopped before leaving to study the picture closely , marvelling at its resemblance to charles and memorising every minute detail of the cryptical , colourless face , even down to a slight scar or pit in the smooth brow above the right eye . cosmo alexander , he decided , was a painter worthy of the scotland that produced raeburn , and a teacher worthy of his illustrious pupil gilbert stuart .\\n\\nassured by the doctor that charles\\'s mental health was in no danger , but that on the other hand he was engaged in researches which might prove of real importance , the wards were more lenient than they might otherwise have been when during the following june the youth made positive his refusal to attend college . he had , he declared , studies of much more vital importance to pursue ; and intimated a wish to go abroad the following year in order to avail himself of certain sources of data not existing in america . the senior ward , while denying this latter wish as absurd for a boy of only eighteen , acquiesced regarding the university ; so that after a none too brilliant graduation from the moses brown school there ensued for charles a three-year period of intensive occult study and graveyard searching . he became recognised as an eccentric , and dropped even more completely from the sight of his family\\'s friends than he had been before ; keeping close to his work and only occasionally making trips to other cities to consult obscure records . once he went south to talk to a strange mulatto who dwelt in a swamp and about whom a newspaper hand printed a curious article . again he sought a small village in the adirondacks whence reports of certain odd ceremonial practices had come . but still his parents forbade him the trip to the old world which he desired .\\n\\ncoming of age in april , 1923 , and having previously inherited a small competence from his maternal grandfather , ward determined at last to take the european trip hitherto denied him . of his proposed itinerary he would say nothing save that the needs of his studies would carry him to many places , but he promised to write his parents fully and faithfully . when they saw he could not be dissuaded , they ceased all opposition and helped as best they could ; so that in june the young man sailed for liverpool with the farewell blessings of his father and mother , who accompanied him to boston and waved him out of sight from the white star pier in charlestown . letters soon told of his safe arrival , and of his securing good quarters in great russell street , london ; where he proposed to stay , shunning all family friends , till he had exhausted the resources of the british museum in a certain direction . of his daily life he wrote by little , for there was little to write . study and experiment consumed all his time , and he mentioned a laboratory which he had established in one of his rooms . that he said nothing of antiquarian rambles in the glamorous old city with its luring skyline of ancient domes and steeples and its tangles of roads and alleys whose mystic convolutions and sudden vistas alternately beckon and surprise , was taken by his parents as a good index of the degree to which his new interests had engrossed his mind .\\n\\nin june , 1924 , a brief note told of his departure for paris , to which he had before made one or two flying trips for material in the biblioth\\xc3\\xa8que nationale . for three months thereafter he sent only postal cards , giving an address in the rue st . jacques and referring to a special search among rare manuscripts in the library of an unnamed private collector . he avoided acquaintances , and no tourists brought back reports of having seen him . then came a silence , and in october the wards received a picture card from prague , czecho-slovakia , stating that charles was in that ancient town for the purpose of conferring with a certain very aged man supposed to be the last living possessor of some very curious mediaeval information . he gave an address in the neustadt , and announced no move till the following january ; when he dropped several cards from vienna telling of his passage through that city on the way toward a more easterly region whither one of his correspondents and fellow-delvers into the occult had invited him .\\n\\nthe next card was from klausenburg in transylvania , and told of ward\\'s progress toward his destination . he was going to visit a baron ferenczy , whose estate lay in the mountains east of rakus ; and was to be addressed at rakus in the care of that nobleman . another card from rakus a week later , saying that his host\\'s carriage had met him and that he was leaving the village for the mountains , was his last message for a considerable time ; indeed , he did reply to his parents\\' frequent letters until may , when he wrote to discourage the plan of his mother for a meeting in london , paris , or rome during the summer , when the elder wards were planning to travel to europe . his researches , he said , were such that he could not leave his present quarters ; while the situation of baron ferenczy\\'s castle did not favour visits . it was on a crag in the dark wooded mountains , and the region was so shunned by the country folk that normal people could not help feeling ill at ease . moreover , the baron was not a person likely to appeal to correct and conservative new england gentlefolk . his aspect and manners had idiosyncrasies , and his age was so great as to be disquieting . it would be better , charles said , if his parents would wait for his return to providence ; which could scarcely be far distant .\\n\\nthat return did not , however , take place until may 1926 , when after a few heralding cards the young wanderer quietly slipped into new york on the homeric and traversed the long miles to providence by motor-coach , eagerly drinking in the green rolling hills , and fragrant , blossoming orchards , and the white steepled towns of vernal connecticut ; his first taste of ancient new england in nearly four years . when the coach crossed the pawcatuck and entered rhode island amidst the faery goldenness of a late spring afternoon his heart beat with quickened force , and the entry to providence along reservoir and elmwood avenues was a breathless and wonderful thing despite the depths of forbidden lore to which he had delved . at the high square where broad , weybosset , and empire streets join , he saw before and below him in the fire of sunset the pleasant , remembered houses and domes and steeples of the old town ; and his head swam curiously as the vehicle rolled down to the terminal behind the biltmore , bringing into view the great dome and soft , roof-pierced greenery of the ancient hill across the river , and the tall colonial spire of the first baptist church limned pink in the magic evening against the fresh springtime verdure of its precipitous background .\\n\\nold providence ! it was this place and the mysterious forces of its long , continuous history which had brought him into being , and which had drawn him back toward marvels and secrets whose boundaries no prophet might fix . here lay the arcana , wondrous or dreadful as the case may be , for which all his years of travel and application had been preparing him . a taxicab whirled him through post office square with its glimpse of the river , the old market house , and the head of the bay , and up the steep curved slope of waterman street to prospect , where the vast gleaming dome and sunset-flushed ionic columns of the christian science church beckoned northward . then eight squares past the fine old estates his childish eyes had known , and the quaint brick sidewalks so often trodden by his youthful feet . and at last the little white overtaken farmhouse on the right , on the left the classic adam porch and stately facade of the great brick house where he was born . it was twilight , and charles dexter ward had come home .\\n\\n5\\n\\na school of alienists slightly less academic than dr . lyman\\'s assign to ward\\'s european trip the beginning of his true madness . admitting that he was sane when he started , they believe that his conduct upon returning implies a disastrous change . but even to this claim dr . willett refuses to concede . there was , he insists , something later ; and the queerness of the youth at this stage he attributes to the practice of rituals learned abroad--odd enough things , to be sure , but by no means implying mental aberration on the part of their celebrant . ward himself , though visibly aged and hardened , was still normal in his general reactions ; and in several talks with dr . willett displayed a balance which no madman--even an incipient one--could feign continuously for long . what elicited the notion of insanity at this period were the sounds heard at all hours from ward\\'s attic laboratory , in which he kept himself most of the time . there were chantings and repetitions , and thunderous declamations in uncanny rhythms ; and although these sounds were always in ward\\'s own voice , there was something in the quality of that voice , and in the accents of the formulae it pronounced , which could not by chill the blood of every hearer . it was noticed that nig , the venerable and beloved black cat of the household , bristled and arched his back perceptibly when certain of the tones were heard .\\n\\nthe odours occasionally wafted from the laboratory were likewise exceedingly strange . sometimes they were very noxious , but more often they were aromatic , with a haunting , elusive quality which seemed to have the power of inducing fantastic images . people who smelled them had a tendency to glimpse momentary mirages of enormous vistas , with strange hills or endless avenues of sphinxes and hippogriffs stretching off into infinite distance . ward did not resume his old-time rambles , but applied himself diligently to the strange books he had brought home , and to equally strange delvings within his quarters ; explaining that european sources had greatly enlarged the possibilities of his work , and promising great revelations in the years to come . his older aspect increased to a startling degree his resemblance to the curwen portrait in his library ; and dr . willett would often pause by the latter after a call , marvelling at the virtual identity , and reflecting that only the small pit above the picture\\'s right eye now remained to differentiate the long-dead wizard from the living youth . these calls of willett\\'s , undertaken at the request of the senior wards , were curious affairs . ward at no time repulsed the doctor , but the latter saw that he could never reach the young man\\'s inner psychology . frequently he noted peculiar things about ; little wax images of grotesque design on the shelves or tables , and the half-erased remnants of circles , triangles , and pentagrams in chalk or charcoal on the cleared central space of the large room . and always in the night those rhythms and incantations thundered , till it became very difficult to keep servants or suppress furtive talk of charles\\'s madness .\\n\\nin january , 1927 , a peculiar incident occurred . one night about midnight , as charles was chanting a ritual whose weird cadence echoed unpleasantly through the house below , there came a sudden gust of chill wind from the bay , and a faint , obscure trembling of the earth which everyone in the neighbourhood noted . at the same time the cat exhibited phenomenal traces of fright , while dogs bayed for as much as a mile around . this was the prelude to a sharp thunderstorm , anomalous for the season , which brought with it such a crash that mr . and mrs . ward believed the house had been struck . they rushed upstairs to see what damage had been done , but charles met them at the door to the attic ; pale , resolute , and portentous , with an almost fearsome combination of triumph and seriousness on his face . he assured them that the house had not really been struck , and that the storm would soon be over . they paused , and looking through a window saw that he was indeed right ; for the lightning flashed farther and farther off , whilst the trees ceased to bend in the strange frigid gust from the water . the thunder sank to a sort of dull mumbling chuckle and finally died away . stars came out , and the stamp of triumph on charles ward\\'s face crystallised into a very singular expression .\\n\\nfor two months or more after this incident ward was less confined than usual to his laboratory . he exhibited a curious interest in the weather , and made odd inquires about the date of the spring thawing of the ground . one night late in march he left the house after midnight , and did not return till almost morning ; when his mother , being wakeful , heard a rumbling motor draw up to the carriage entrance . muffled oaths could be distinguished , and mrs . ward , rising and going to the window , saw four dark figures removing a long , heavy box from a truck at charles\\'s direction and carrying it within by the side door . she heard laboured breathing and ponderous footfalls on the stairs , and finally a dull thumping in the attic ; after which the footfalls descended again , and the four reappeared outside and drove off in their truck .\\n\\nthe next day charles resumed his strict attic seclusion , drawing down the dark shades of his laboratory windows and appearing to be working on some metal substance . he would open the door to no one , and steadfastly refused all proffered food . about noon a wrenching sound followed by a terrible cry and a fall were heard , but when mrs . ward rapped at the door her son at length answered faintly , and told her that nothing had gone amiss . the hideous and indescribable stench now welling out was absolutely harmless and unfortunately necessary . solitude was the one prime essential , and he would appear later for dinner . that afternoon , after the conclusion of some odd hissing sounds which came from behind the locked portal , he did finally appear ; wearing an extremely haggard aspect and forbidding anyone to enter the laboratory upon any pretext . this , indeed , proved the beginning of a new policy of secrecy ; for never afterward was any other person permitted to visit either the mysterious garret workroom or the adjacent storeroom which he cleaned out , furnished roughly , and added to his inviolable private domain as a sleeping apartment . here he lived , with books brought up from his library beneath , till the time he purchased the pawtuxet bungalow and moved to it all his scientific effects .\\n\\nin the evening charles secured the paper before the rest of the family and damaged part of it through an apparent accident . later on dr . willett , having fixed the date from statements by various members of the household , looked up an intact copy at the journal office and found that in the destroyed section the following small item had occurred :\\n\\nnocturnal diggers surprised in north burial ground\\n\\nrobert hart , night watchman at the north burial ground , this morning discovered a party of several men with a motor truck in the oldest part of the cemetery , but apparently frightened them off before they had accomplished whatever their object may have been .\\n\\nthe discovery took place at about four o\\'clock , when hart\\'s attention was attracted by the sound of a motor outside his shelter . investigating , he saw a large truck on the main drive several rods away ; but could not reach it before the noise of his feet on the gravel had revealed his approach . the men hastily placed a large box in the truck and drove away toward the street before they could be overtaken ; and since no known grave was disturbed , hart believes that this box was an object which they wished to bury .\\n\\nthe diggers must have been at work for a long while before detection , for hart found an enormous hold dug at a considerable distance back from the roadway in the lot of amasa field , where most of the old stones have long ago disappeared . the hole , a place as large and deep as a grave , was empty ; and did not coincide with any interment mentioned in the cemetery records .\\n\\nsergt . riley of the second station viewed the spot and gave the opinion that the hole was dug by bootleggers rather gruesomely and ingeniously seeking a safe cache for liquor in a place not likely to be disturbed . in reply to questions hart said he though the escaping truck had headed up rochambeau avenue , though he could not be sure .\\n\\nduring the next few days charles ward was seldom seen by his family . having added sleeping quarters to his attic realm , he kept closely to himself there , ordering food brought to the door and not taking it in until after the servant had gone away . the droning of monotonous formulae and the chanting of bizarre rhythms recurred at intervals , while at other times occasional listeners could detect the sound of tinkling glass , hissing chemicals , running water , or roaring gas flames . odours of the most unplaceable quality , wholly unlike any before noted , hung at times around the door ; and the air of tension observable in the young recluse whenever he did venture briefly forth was such as to excite the keenest speculation . once he made a hasty trip to the athenaeum for a book he required , and again he hired a messenger to fetch him a highly obscure volume from boston . suspense was written portentously over the whole situation , and both the family and dr . willett confessed themselves wholly at a loss what to do or think about it .\\n\\n6\\n\\nthen on the fifteenth of april a strange development occurred . while nothing appeared to grow different in kind , there was certainly a very terrible difference in degree ; and dr . willett somehow attaches great significance to the change . the day was good friday , a circumstance of which the servants made much , but which others quite naturally dismiss as an irrelevant coincidence . late in the afternoon young ward began repeating a certain formula in a singularly loud voice , at the same time burning some substance so pungent that its fumes escaped over the entire house . the formula was so plainly audible in the hall outside the locked door that mrs . ward could not help memorising it as she waited and listened anxiously , and later on she was able to write it down at dr . willett\\'s request . it ran as follows , and experts have told dr . willett that its very close analogue can be found in the mystic writings of \"eliphas levi\" , that cryptic soul who crept through a crack in the forbidden door and glimpsed the frightful vistas of the void beyond :\\n\\n\\'per adonai eloim , adonai jehova , adonai sabaoth , metraton on agla mathon , verbum pythonicum , mysterium salamandrae , conventus sylvorum , antra gnomorum , daemonia coeli gad , almonsin , gibor , jehosua , evam , zariatnatmik , veni , veni , veni .\\'\\n\\nthis had been going on for two hours without change or intermission when over all the neighbourhood a pandaemoniac howling of dogs set in . the extent of this howling can be judged from the space it received in the papers the next day , but to those in the ward household it was overshadowed by the odour which instantly followed it ; a hideous , all-pervasive odour which none of them had ever smelt before or have ever smelt since . in the midst of this mephitic flood there came a very perceptible flash like that of lightning , which would have been blinding and impressive but for the daylight around ; and then was heard the voice that no listener can ever forget because of its thunderous remoteness , its incredible depth , and its eldritch dissimilarity to charles ward\\'s voice . it shook the house , and was clearly heard by at least two neighbours above the howling of the dogs . mrs . ward , who had been listening in despair outside her son\\'s locked laboratory , shivered as she recognised its hellish imports ; for charles had told of its evil fame in dark books , and of the manner in which it had thundered , according to the fenner letter , above the doomed pawtuxet farmhouse on the night of joseph curwen\\'s annihilation . there was no mistaking that nightmare phrase , for charles had described it too vividly in the old days when he had talked frankly of his curwen investigations . and yet it was only this fragment of an archaic and forgotten language : \\'dies mies jeschet boene doesef douvema enitemaus .\\'\\n\\nclose upon this thundering there came a momentary darkening of the daylight , though sunset was still an hour distant , and then a puff of added odour different from the first but equally unknown and intolerable . charles was chanting again now and his mother could hear syllables that sounded like \\'yi nash yog sothoth he lgeb throdog\\'--ending in a \\'yah !\\' whose maniacal force mounted in an ear-splitting crescendo . a second later all previous memories were effaced by the wailing scream which burst out with frantic explosiveness and gradually changed form to a paroxysm of diabolic and hysterical laughter . mrs . ward , with the mingled fear and blind courage of maternity , advanced and knocked affrightedly at the concealing panels , but obtained no sign of recognition . she knocked again , but paused nervelessly as a second shriek arose , this one unmistakably in the familiar voice of her son , and sounding concurrently with the still bursting cachinnations of that other voice . presently she fainted , although she is still unable to recall the precise and immediate cause . memory sometimes makes merciful deletions .\\n\\nmr . ward returned from the business section at about quarter past six ; and not finding his wife downstairs , was told by the frightened servants that she was probably watching at charles\\'s door , from which the sounds had been far stranger than ever before . mounting the stairs at once , he saw mrs . ward stretched out at full length on the floor of the corridor outside the laboratory ; and realising that she had fainted , hastened to fetch a glass of water from a set bowl in a neighbouring alcove . dashing the cold fluid in her face , he was heartened to observe an immediate response on her part , and was watching the bewildered opening of her eyes when a chill shot through him and threatened to reduce him to the very state from which she was emerging . for the seemingly silent laboratory was not as silent as it had appeared to be , but held the murmurs of a tense , muffled conversation in tones too low for comprehension , yet of a quality profoundly disturbing to the soul .\\n\\nit was not , of course , new for charles to mutter formulae ; but this muttering was definitely different . it was so palpably a dialogue , or imitation of a dialogue , with the regular alteration of inflections suggesting question and answer , statement and response . one voice was undisguisedly that of charles , but the other had a depth and hollowness which the youth\\'s best powers of ceremonial mimicry had scarcely approached before . there was something hideous , blasphemous , and abnormal about it , and but for a cry from his recovering wife which cleared his mind by arousing his protective instincts it is not likely that theodore howland ward could have maintained for nearly a year more his old boast that he had never fainted . as it was , he seized his wife in his arms and bore her quickly downstairs before she could notice the voices which had so horribly disturbed him . even so , however , he was not quick enough to escape catching something himself which caused him to stagger dangerously with his burden . for mrs . ward\\'s cry had evidently been heard by others than he , and there had come in response to it from behind the locked door the first distinguishable words which that masked and terrible colloquy had yielded . they were merely an excited caution in charles\\'s own voice , but somehow their implications held a nameless fright for the father who overheard them . the phrase was just this : \\'sshh !--write !\\'\\n\\nmr . and mrs . ward conferred at some length after dinner , and the former resolved to have a firm and serious talk with charles that very night . no matter how important the object , such conduct could no longer be permitted ; for these latest developments transcended every limit of sanity and formed a menace to the order and nervous well-being of the entire household . the youth must indeed have taken complete leave of his senses , since only downright madness could have prompted the wild screams and imaginary conversations in assumed voices which the present day had brought forth . all this must be stopped , or mrs . ward would be made ill and the keeping of servants become an impossibility .\\n\\nmr . ward rose at the close of the meal and started upstairs for charles\\'s laboratory . on the third floor , however , he paused at the sounds which he heard proceeding from the now disused library of his son . books were apparently being flung about and papers wildly rustled , and upon stepping to the door mr . ward beheld the youth within , excitedly assembling a vast armful of literary matter of every size and shape . charles\\'s aspect was very drawn and haggard , and he dropped his entire load with a start at the sound of his father\\'s voice . at the elder man\\'s command he sat down , and for some time listened to the admonitions he had so long deserved . there was no scene . at the end of the lecture he agreed that his father was right , and that his noises , mutterings , incantations , and chemical odours were indeed inexcusable nuisances . he agreed to a policy of great quiet , though insisting on a prolongation of his extreme privacy . much of his future work , he said , was in any case purely book research ; and he could obtain quarters elsewhere for any such vocal rituals as might be necessary at a later stage . for the fright and fainting of his mother he expressed the keenest contrition , and explained that the conversation later heard was part of an elaborate symbolism designed to create a certain mental atmosphere . his use of abstruse technical terms somewhat bewildered mr . ward , but the parting impression was one of undeniable sanity and poise despite a mysterious tension of the utmost gravity . the interview was really quite inconclusive , and as charles picked up his armful and left the room mr . ward hardly knew what to make of the entire business . it was as mysterious as the death of poor old nig , whose stiffening form had been found an hour before in the basement , with staring eyes and fear-distorted mouth .\\n\\ndriven by some vague detective instinct , the bewildered parent now glanced curiously at the vacant shelves to see what his son had taken up to the attic . the youth\\'s library was plainly and rigidly classified , so that one might tell at a glance the books or at least the kind of books which had been withdrawn . on this occasion mr . ward was astonished to find that nothing of the occult or the antiquarian , beyond what had been previously removed , was missing . these new withdrawals were all modern items ; histories , scientific treatises , geographies , manuals of literature , philosophic works , and certain contemporary newspapers and magazines . it was a very curious shift from charles ward\\'s recent run of reading , and the father paused in a growing vortex of perplexity and an engulfing sense of strangeness . the strangeness was a very poignant sensation , and almost clawed at his chest as he strove to see just what was wrong around him . something was indeed wrong , and tangibly as well as spiritually so . ever since he had been in this room he had known that something was amiss , and at last it dawned upon him what it was .\\n\\non the north wall rose still the ancient carved overmantel from the house in olney court , but to the cracked and precariously restored oils of the large curwen portrait disaster had come . time and unequal heating had done their work at last , and at some time since the room\\'s last cleaning the worst had happened . peeling clear of the wood , curling tighter and tighter , and finally crumbling into small bits with what must have been malignly silent suddenness , the portrait of joseph curwen had resigned forever its staring surveillance of the youth it so strangely resembled , and now lay scattered on the floor as a thin coating of fine blue-grey dust .\\n\\niv . a mutation and a madness\\n\\n1\\n\\nin the week following that memorable good friday charles ward was seen more often than usual , and was continually carrying books between his library and the attic laboratory . his actions were quiet and rational , but he had a furtive , hunted look which his mother did not like , and developed an incredibly ravenous appetite as gauged by his demands upon the cook . dr . willett had been told of those friday noises and happenings , and on the following tuesday had a long conversation with the youth in the library where the picture stared no more . the interview was , as always , inconclusive ; but willett is still ready to swear that the youth was sane and himself at the time . he held out promises of an early revelation , and spoke of the need of securing a laboratory elsewhere . at the loss of the portrait he grieved singularly little considering his first enthusiasm over it , but seemed to find something of positive humour in its sudden crumbling .\\n\\nabout the second week charles began to be absent from the house for long periods , and one day when good old black hannah came to help with the spring cleaning she mentioned his frequent visits to the old house in olney court , where he would come with a large valise and perform curious delvings in the cellar . he was always very liberal to her and to old asa , but seemed more worried than he used to be ; which grieved her very much , since she had watched him grow up from birth . another report of his doings came from pawtuxet , where some friends of the family saw him at a distance a surprising number of times . he seemed to haunt the resort and canoe-house of rhodes-on-the-pawtuxet , and subsequent inquiries by dr . willett at that place brought out the fact that his purpose was always to secure access to the rather hedged-in river-bank , along which he would walk toward the north , usually not reappearing for a very long while .\\n\\nlate in may came a momentary revival of ritualistic sounds in the attic laboratory which brought a stern reproof from mr . ward and a somewhat distracted promise of amendment from charles . it occurred one morning , and seemed to form a resumption of the imaginary conversation noted on that turbulent good friday . the youth was arguing or remonstrating hotly with himself , for there suddenly burst forth a perfectly distinguishable series of clashing shouts in differentiated tones like alternate demands and denials which caused mrs . ward to run upstairs and listen at the door . she could hear no more than a fragment whose only plain words were \\'must have it red for three months\\' , and upon her knocking all sounds ceased at once . when charles was later questioned by his father he said that there were certain conflicts of spheres of consciousness which only great skill could avoid , but which he would try to transfer to other realms .\\n\\nabout the middle of june a queer nocturnal incident occurred . in the early evening there had been some noise and thumping in the laboratory upstairs , and mr . ward was on the point of investigating when it suddenly quieted down . that midnight , after the family had retired , the butler was nightlocking the front door when according to his statement charles appeared somewhat blunderingly and uncertainly at the foot of the stairs with a large suitcase and made signs that he wished egress . the youth spoke no word , but the worthy yorkshireman caught one sight of his fevered eyes and trembled causelessly . he opened the door and young ward went out , but in the morning he presented his resignation to mrs . ward . there was , he said , something unholy in the glance charles had fixed on him . it was no way for a young gentleman to look at an honest person , and he could not possibly stay another night . mrs . ward allowed the man to depart , but she did not value his statement highly . to fancy charles in a savage state that night was quite ridiculous , for as long as she had remained awake she had heard faint sounds from the laboratory above ; sounds as if of sobbing and pacing , and of a sighing which told only of despair\\'s profoundest depths . mrs . ward had grown used to listening for sounds in the night , for the mystery of her son was fast driving all else from her mind .\\n\\nthe next evening , much as on another evening nearly three months before , charles ward seized the newspaper very early and accidentally lost the main section . this matter was not recalled till later , when dr . willett began checking up loose ends and searching out missing links here and there . in the journal office he found the section which charles had lost , and marked two items as of possible significance . they were as follows :\\n\\nmore cemetery delving\\n\\nit was this morning discovered by robert hart , night watchman at the north burial ground , that ghouls were again at work in the ancient portion of the cemetery . the grave of ezra weeden , who was born in 1740 and died in 1824 according to his uprooted and savagely splintered slate headstone , was found excavated and rifled , the work being evidently done with a spade stolen from an adjacent tool-shed .\\n\\nwhatever the contents may have been after more than a century of burial , all was gone except a few slivers of decayed wood . there were no wheel tracks , but the police have measured a single set of footprints which they found in the vicinity , and which indicate the boots of a man of refinement .\\n\\nhart is inclined to link this incident with the digging discovered last march , when a party in a motor truck were frightened away after making a deep excavation ; but sergt . riley of the second station discounts this theory and points to vital differences in the two cases . in march the digging had been in a spot where no grave was known ; but this time a well-marked and cared-for grave had been rifled with every evidence of deliberate purpose , and with a conscious malignity expressed in the splintering of the slab which had been intact up to the day before .\\n\\nmembers of the weeden family , notified of the happening , expressed their astonishment and regret ; and were wholly unable to think of any enemy who would care to violate the grave of their ancestor . hazard weeden of 598 angell street recalls a family legend according to which ezra weeden was involved in some very peculiar circumstances , not dishonourable to himself , shortly before the revolution ; but of any modern feud or mystery he is frankly ignorant . inspector cunningham has been assigned to the case , and hopes to uncover some valuable clues in the near future .\\n\\ndogs noisy in pawtuxet\\n\\nresidents of pawtuxet were aroused about 3 a .m . today by a phenomenal baying of dogs which seemed to centre near the river just north of rhodes-on-the-pawtuxet . the volume and quality of the howling were unusually odd , according to most who heard it ; and fred lemdin , night watchman at rhodes , declares it was mixed with something very like the shrieks of a man in mortal terror and agony . a sharp and very brief thunderstorm , which seemed to strike somewhere near the bank of the river , put an end to the disturbance . strange and unpleasant odours , probably from the oil tanks along the bay , are popularly linked with this incident ; and may have had their share in exciting the dogs .\\n\\nthe aspect of charles now became very haggard and hunted , and all agreed in retrospect that he may have wished at this period to make some statement or confession from which sheer terror withheld him . the morbid listening of his mother in the night brought out the fact that he made frequent sallies abroad under cover of darkness , and most of the more academic alienists unite at present in charging him with the revolting cases of vampirism which the press so sensationally reported about this time , but which have not yet been definitely traced to any known perpetrator . these cases , too recent and celebrated to need detailed mention , involved victims of every age and type and seemed to cluster around two distinct localities ; the residential hill and the north end , near the ward home , and the suburban districts across the cranston line near pawtuxet . both late wayfarers and sleepers with open windows were attacked , and those who lived to tell the tale spoke unanimously of a lean , lithe , leaping monster with burning eyes which fastened its teeth in the throat or upper arm and feasted ravenously .\\n\\ndr . willett , who refuses to date the madness of charles ward as far back as even this , is cautious in attempting to explain these horrors . he has , he declares , certain theories of his own ; and limits his positive statements to a peculiar kind of negation : \\'i will not ,\\' he says , \\'state who or what i believe perpetrated these attacks and murders , but i will declare that charles ward was innocent of them . i have reason to be sure he was ignorant of the taste of blood , as indeed his continued anaemic decline and increasing pallor prove better than any verbal argument . ward meddled with terrible things , but he has paid for it , and he was never a monster or a villain . as for now--i don\\'t like to think . a change came , and i\\'m content to believe that the old charles ward died with it . his soul did , anyhow , for that mad flesh that vanished from waite\\'s hospital had another .\\'\\n\\nwillett speaks with authority , for he was often at the ward home attending mrs . ward , whose nerves had begun to snap under the strain . her nocturnal listening had bred some morbid hallucinations which she confided to the doctor with hesitancy , and which he ridiculed in talking to her , although they made him ponder deeply when alone . these delusions always concerned the faint sounds which she fancied she heard in the attic laboratory and bedroom , and emphasised the occurrence of muffled sighs and sobbings at the most impossible times . early in july willett ordered mrs . ward to atlantic city for an indefinite recuperative sojourn , and cautioned both mr . ward and the haggard and elusive charles to write her only cheering letters . it is probably to this enforced and reluctant escape that she owes her life and continued sanity .\\n\\n2\\n\\nnot long after his mother\\'s departure , charles ward began negotiating for the pawtuxet bungalow . it was a squalid little wooden edifice with a concrete garage , perched high on the sparsely settled bank of the river slightly above rhodes , but for some odd reason the youth would have nothing else . he gave the real-estate agencies no peace till one of them secured it for him at an exorbitant price from a somewhat reluctant owner , and as soon as it was vacant he took possession under cover of darkness , , transporting in a great closed van the entire contents of his attic laboratory , including the books both weird and modern which he had borrowed from his study . he had this van loaded in the black small hours , and his father recalls only a drowsy realisation of stifled oaths and stamping feet on the night the goods were taken away . after that charles moved back to his own old quarters on the third floor , and never haunted the attic again .\\n\\nto the pawtuxet bungalow charles transferred all the secrecy with which he had surrounded his attic realm , save that he now appeared to have two sharers of his mysteries ; a villainous-looking portuguese half-caste from the south main st . waterfront who acted as a servant , and a thin , scholarly stranger with dark glasses and a stubbly full beard of dyed aspect whose status was evidently that of a colleague . neighbours vainly tried to engage these odd persons in conversation . the mulatto gomes spoke very little english , and the bearded man , who gave his name as dr . allen , voluntarily followed his example . ward himself tried to be more affable , but succeeded only in provoking curiousity with his rambling accounts of chemical research . before long queer tales began to circulate regarding the all-night burning of lights ; and somewhat later , after this burning had suddenly ceased , there rose still queerer tales of disproportionate orders of meat from the butcher\\'s and of the muffled shouting , declamation , rhythmic chanting , and screaming supposed to come from some very deep cellar below the place . most distinctly the new and strange household was bitterly disliked by the honest bourgeoisie of the vicinity , and it is not remarkable that dark hints were advanced connecting the hated establishment with the current epidemic of vampiristic attacks and murders ; especially since the radius of that plague seemed now confined wholly to pawtuxet and the adjacent streets of edgewood .\\n\\nward spent most of his time at the bungalow , but slept occasionally at home and was still reckoned a dweller beneath his father\\'s roof . twice he was absent from the city on week-long trips , whose destinations have not yet been discovered . he grew steadily paler and more emaciated even than before , and lacked some of his former assurance when repeating to dr . willett his old , old story of vital research and future revelations . willett often waylaid him at his father\\'s house , for the elder ward was deeply worried and perplexed , and wished his son to get as much sound oversight as could be managed in the case of so secretive and independent an adult . the doctor still insists that the youth was sane even as late as this , and adduces many a conversation to prove his point .\\n\\nabout september the vampirism declined , but in the following january almost became involved in serious trouble . for some time the nocturnal arrival and departure of motor trucks at the pawtuxet bungalow had been commented upon , and at this juncture an unforeseen hitch exposed the nature of at least one item of their contents . in a lonely spot near hope valley had occurred one of the frequent sordid waylaying of trucks by \"hi-jackers\" in quest of liquor shipments , but this time the robbers had been destined to receive the greater shock . for the long cases they seized proved upon opening to contain some exceedingly gruesome things ; so gruesome , in fact , that the matter could not be kept quiet amongst the denizens of the underworld . the thieves had hastily buried what they discovered , but when the state police got wind of the matter a careful search was made . a recently arrived vagrant , under promise of immunity from prosecution on any additional charge , at last consented to guide a party of troopers to the spot ; and there was found in that hasty cache a very hideous and shameful thing . it would not be well for the national--or even the international--sense of decorum if the public were ever to know what was uncovered by that awestruck party . there was no mistaking it , even by those far from studious officers ; and telegrams to washington ensued with feverish rapidity .\\n\\nthe cases were addressed to charles ward at his pawtuxet bungalow , and state and federal officials at once paid him a very forceful and serious call . they found him pallid and worried with his two odd companions , and received from him what seemed to be a valid explanation and evidence of innocence . he had needed certain anatomical specimens as part of a programme of research whose depth and genuineness anyone who had known him in the last decade could prove , and had ordered the required kind and number from agencies which he had thought as reasonably legitimate as such things can be . of the identity of the specimens he had known absolutely nothing , and was properly shocked when the inspectors hinted at the monstrous effect on public sentiment and national dignity which a knowledge of the matter would produce . in this statement he was firmly sustained by his bearded colleague dr . allen , whose oddly hollow voice carried even more conviction than his own nervous tones ; so that in the end the officials took no action , but carefully set down the new york name and address which ward gave them a basis for a search which came to nothing . it is only fair to add that the specimens were quickly and quietly restored to their proper places , and that the general public will never know of their blasphemous disturbance .\\n\\non february 9 , 1928 , dr . willett received a letter from charles ward which he considers of extraordinary importance , and about which he has frequently quarrelled with dr . lyman . lyman believes that this note contains positive proof of a well-developed case of dementia praecox , but willett on the other hand regards it as the last perfectly sane utterance of the hapless youth . he calls especial attention to the normal character of the penmanship ; which though shewing traces of shattered nerves , is nevertheless distinctly ward\\'s own . the text in full is as follows :\\n\\n100 prospect st . providence , r .i . , february 8 , 1928 .\\n\\ndear dr . willett :-\\n\\ni feel that at last the time has come for me to make the disclosures which i have so long promised you , and for which you have pressed me so often . the patience you have shewn in waiting , and the confidence you have shewn in my mind and integrity , are things i shall never cease to appreciate .\\n\\nand now that i am ready to speak , i must own with humiliation that no triumph such as i dreamed of can ever be mine . instead of triumph i have found terror , and my talk with you will not be a boast of victory but a plea for help and advice in saving both myself and the world from a horror beyond all human conception or calculation . you recall what those fenner letters said of the old raiding party at pawtuxet . that must all be done again , and quickly . upon us depends more than can be put into words--all civilisation , all natural law , perhaps even the fate of the solar system and the universe . i have brought to light a monstrous abnormality , but i did it for the sake of knowledge . now for the sake of all life and nature you must help me thrust it back into the dark again .\\n\\ni have left that pawtuxet place forever , and we must extirpate everything existing there , alive or dead . i shall not go there again , and you must not believe it if you ever hear that i am there . i will tell you why i say this when i see you . i have come home for good , and wish you would call on me at the very first moment that you can spare five or six hours continuously to hear what i have to say . it will take that long--and believe me when i tell you that you never had a more genuine professional duty than this . my life and reason are the very least things which hang in the balance .\\n\\ni dare not tell my father , for he could not grasp the whole thing . but i have told him of my danger , and he has four men from a detective agency watching the house . i don\\'t know how much good they can do , for they have against them forces which even you could scarcely envisage or acknowledge . so come quickly if you wish to see me alive and hear how you may help to save the cosmos from stark hell .\\n\\nany time will do--i shall not be out of the house . don\\'t telephone ahead , for there is no telling who or what may try to intercept you . and let us pray to whatever gods there be that nothing may prevent this meeting .\\n\\nin utmost gravity and desperation ,\\n\\ncharles dexter ward .\\n\\np .s . shoot dr . allen on sight and dissolve his body in acid . don\\'t burn it .\\n\\ndr . willett received this note about 10 :30 a .m . , and immediately arranged to spare the whole late afternoon and evening for the momentous talk , letting it extend on into the night as long as might be necessary . he planned to arrive about four o\\'clock , and through all the intervening hours was so engulfed in every sort of wild speculation that most of his tasks were very mechanically performed . maniacal as the letter would have sounded to a stranger , willett had seen too much of charles ward\\'s oddities to dismiss it as sheer raving . that something very subtle , ancient , and horrible was hovering about he felt quite sure , and the reference to dr . allen could almost be comprehended in view of what pawtuxet gossip said of ward\\'s enigmatical colleague . willett had never seen the man , but had heard much of his aspect and bearing , and could not but wonder what sort of eyes those much-discussed dark glasses might conceal .\\n\\npromptly at four dr . willett presented himself at the ward residence , but found to his annoyance that charles had not adhered to his determination to remain indoors . the guards were there , but said that the young man seemed to have lost part of his timidity . he had that morning done much apparently frightened arguing and protesting over the telephone , one of the detectives said , replying to some unknown voice with phrases such as \\'i am very tired and must rest a while\\' , \\'i can\\'t receive anyone for some time\\' , \\'you\\'ll have to excuse me\\' , \\'please postpone decisive action till we can arrange some sort of compromise\\' , or \\'i am very sorry , but i must take a complete vacation from everything ; i\\'ll talk with you later .\\' then , apparently gaining boldness through meditation , he had slipped out so quietly that no one had seen him depart or knew that he had gone until he returned about one o\\'clock and entered the house without a word . he had gone upstairs , where a bit of his fear must have surged back ; for he was heard to cry out in a highly terrified fashion upon entering his library , afterward trailing off into a kind of choking gasp . when , however , the butler had gone to inquire what the trouble was , he had appeared at the door with a great show of boldness , and had silently gestured the man away in a manner that terrified him unaccountably . then he had evidently done some rearranging of his shelves , for a great clattering and thumping and creaking ensued ; after which he had reappeared and left at once . willett inquired whether or not any message had been left , but was told that there was none . the butler seemed queerly disturbed about something in charles\\'s appearance and manner , and asked solicitously if there was much hope for a cure of his disordered nerves .\\n\\nfor almost two hours dr . willett waited vainly in charles ward\\'s library , watching the dusty shelves with their wide gaps where books had been removed , and smiling grimly at the panelled overmantel on the north wall , whence a year before the suave features of old joseph curwen had looked mildly down . after a time the shadows began to gather , and the sunset cheer gave place to a vague growing terror which flew shadow-like before the night . mr . ward finally arrived , and shewed much surprise and anger at his son\\'s absence after all the pains which had been taken to guard him . he had not known of charles\\'s appointment , and promised to notify willett when the youth returned . in bidding the doctor goodnight he expressed his utter perplexity at his son\\'s condition , and urged his caller to do all he could to restore the boy to normal poise . willett was glad to escape from that library , for something frightful and unholy seemed to haunt it ; as if the vanished picture had left behind a legacy of evil . he had never liked that picture ; and even now , strong-nerved though he was , there lurked a quality in its vacant panel which made him feel an urgent need to get out into the pure air as soon as possible .\\n\\n3\\n\\nthe next morning willett received a message from the senior ward , saying that charles was still absent . mr . ward mentioned that dr . allen had telephoned him to say that charles would remain at pawtuxet for some time , and that he must not be disturbed . this was necessary because allen himself was suddenly called away for an indefinite period , leaving the researches in need of charles\\'s constant oversight . charles sent his best wishes , and regretted any bother his abrupt change of plans might have caused . in listening to this message mr . ward heard dr . allen\\'s voice for the first time , and it seemed to excite some vague and elusive memory which could not be actually placed , but which was disturbing to the point of fearfulness .\\n\\nfaced by these baffling and contradictory reports , dr . willett was frankly at a loss what to do . the frantic earnestness of charles\\'s note was not to be denied , yet what could one think of its writer\\'s immediate violation of his own expressed policy ? young ward had written that his delvings had become blasphemous and menacing , that they and his bearded colleague must be extirpated at any cost , and that he himself would never return to their final scene ; yet according to latest advices he had forgotten all this and was back in the thick of the mystery . common sense bade one leave the youth alone with his freakishness , yet some deeper instinct would not permit the impression of that frenzied letter to subside . willett read it over again , and could not make its essence sound as empty and insane as both its bombastic verbiage and its lack of fulfilment would seem to imply . its terror was too profound and real , and in conjunction with what the doctor already knew evoked too vivid hints of monstrosities from beyond time and space to permit of any cynical explanation . there were nameless horrors abroad ; and no matter how little one might be able to get at them , one ought to stand prepared for any sort of action at any time .\\n\\nfor over a week dr . willett pondered on the dilemma which seemed thrust upon him , and became more and more inclined to pay charles a call at the pawtuxet bungalow . no friend of the youth had ever ventured to storm this forbidden retreat , and even his father knew of its interior only from such descriptions as he chose to give ; but willett felt that some direct conversation with his patient was necessary . mr . ward had been receiving brief and non-committal typed notes from his son , and said that mrs . ward in her atlantic city retirement had had no better word . so at length the doctor resolved to act ; and despite a curious sensation inspired by old legends of joseph curwen , and by more recent revelations and warnings from charles ward , set boldly out for the bungalow on the bluff above the river .\\n\\nwillett had visited the spot before through sheer curiousity , though of course never entering the house or proclaiming his presence ; hence knew exactly the route to take . driving out broad street one early afternoon toward the end of february in his small motor , he thought oddly of the grim party which had taken that selfsame road a hundred and fifty-seven years before on a terrible errand which none might ever comprehend .\\n\\nthe ride through the city\\'s decaying fringe was short , and trim edgewood and sleepy pawtuxet presently spread out ahead . willett turned to the right down lockwood street and drove his car as far along that rural road as he could , then alighted and walked north to where the bluff towered above the lovely bends of the river and the sweep of misty downlands beyond . houses were still few here , and there was no mistaking the isolated bungalow with its concrete garage on a high point of land at his left . stepping briskly up the neglected gravel walk he rapped at the door with a firm hand , and spoke without a tremor to the evil portuguese mulatto who opened it to the width of a crack .\\n\\nhe must , he said , see charles ward at once on vitally important business . no excuse would be accepted , and a repulse would mean only a full report of the matter to the elder ward . the mulatto still hesitated , and pushed against the door when willett attempted to open it ; but the doctor merely raised his voice and renewed his demands . then there came from the dark interior a husky whisper which somehow chilled the hearer through and through though he did not know why he feared it . \\'let him in , tony ,\\' it said , \\'we may as well talk now as ever .\\' but disturbing as was the whisper , the greater fear was that which immediately followed . the floor creaked and the speaker hove in sight--and the owner of those strange and resonant tones was seen to be no other than charles dexter ward .\\n\\nthe minuteness with which dr . willett recalled and recorded his conversation of that afternoon is due to the importance he assigns to this particular period . for at last he concedes a vital change in charles dexter ward\\'s mentality , and believes that the youth now spoke from a brain hopelessly alien to the brain whose growth he had watched for six and twenty years . controversy with dr . lyman has compelled him to be very specific , and he definitely dates the madness of charles ward from the time the typewritten notes began to reach his parents . those notes are not in ward\\'s normal style ; not even in the style of that last frantic letter to willett . instead , they are strange and archaic , as if the snapping of the writer\\'s mind had released a flood of tendencies and impressions picked up unconsciously through boyhood antiquarianism . there is an obvious effort to be modern , but the spirit and occasionally the language are those of the past .\\n\\nthe past , too , was evident in ward\\'s every tone and gesture as he received the doctor in that shadowy bungalow . he bowed , motioned willett to a seat , and began to speak abruptly in that strange whisper which he sought to explain at the very outset .\\n\\n\\'i am grown phthisical ,\\' he began , \\'from this cursed river air . you must excuse my speech . i suppose you are come from my father to see what ails me , and i hope you will say nothing to alarm him .\\'\\n\\nwillett was studying these scraping tones with extreme care , but studying even more closely the face of the speaker . something , he felt , was wrong ; and he thought of what the family had told him about the fright of that yorkshire butler one night . he wished it were not so dark , but did not request that the blind be opened . instead , he merely asked ward why he had so belied the frantic note of little more than a week before .\\n\\n\\'i was coming to that ,\\' the host replied . \\'you must know , i am in a very bad state of nerves , and do and say queer things i cannot account for . as i have told you often , i am on the edge of great matters ; and the bigness of them has a way of making me light-headed . any man might well be frighted of what i have found , but i am not to be put off for long . i was a dunce to have that guard and stick at home ; for having gone this far , my place is here . i am not well spoke of by prying neighbours , and perhaps i was led by weakness to believe myself what they say of me . there is no evil to any in what i do , so long as i do it rightly . have the goodness to wait six months , and i\\'ll shew you what will pay your patience well .\\n\\n\\'you may as well know i have a way of learning old matters from things surer than books , and i\\'ll leave you to judge the importance of what i can give to history , philosophy , and the arts by reason of the doors i have access to . my ancestor had all this when those witless peeping toms came and murdered him . i now have it again , or am coming very imperfectly to have a part of it . this time nothing must happen , and least of all through any idiot fears of my own . pray forget all i writ you , sir , and have no fear of this place or any in it . dr . allen is a man of fine parts , and i own him an apology for anything ill i have said of him . i wish i had no need to spare him , but there were things he had to do elsewhere . his zeal is equal to mine in all those matters , and i suppose that when i feared the work i feared him too as my greatest helper in it .\\'\\n\\nward paused , and the doctor hardly knew what to say or think . he felt almost foolish in the face of this calm repudiation of the letter ; and yet there clung to him the fact that while the present discourse was strange and alien and indubitably mad , the note itself had been tragic in its naturalness and likeness to the charles ward he knew . willett now tried to turn the talk on early matters , and recall to the youth some past events which would restore a familiar mood ; but in this process he obtained only the most grotesque results . it was the same with all the alienists later on . important sections of charles ward\\'s store of mental images , mainly those touching modern times and his own personal life , had been unaccountably expunged ; whilst all the massed antiquarianism of his youth had welled up from some profound subconsciousness to engulf the contemporary and the individual . the youth\\'s intimate knowledge of elder things was abnormal and unholy , and he tried his best to hide it . when willett would mention some favourite object of his boyhood archaistic studies he often shed by pure accident such a light as no normal mortal could conceivably be expected to possess , and the doctor shuddered as the glib allusion glided by .\\n\\nit was not wholesome to know so much about the way the fat sheriff\\'s wig fell off as he leaned over at the play in mr . douglass\\'s histrionick academy in king street on the eleventh of february , 1762 , which fell on a thursday ; or about how the actors cut the text of steele\\'s conscious lover so badly that one was almost glad the baptist-ridden legislature closed the theatre a fortnight later . that thomas sabin\\'s boston coach was \"damn\\'d uncomfortable\" old letters may well have told ; but what healthy antiquarian could recall how the creaking of epenetus olney\\'s new signboard (the gaudy crown he set up after he took to calling his tavern the crown coffee house) was exactly like the first few notes of the new jazz piece all the radios in pawtuxet were playing ?\\n\\nward , however , would not be quizzed long in this vein . modern and personal topics he waved aside quite summarily , whilst regarding antique affairs he soon shewed the plainest boredom . what he wished clearly enough was only to satisfy his visitor enough to make him depart without the intention of returning . to this end he offered to shew willett the entire house , and at once proceeded to lead the doctor through every room from cellar to attic . willett looked sharply , but noted that the visible books were far too few and trivial to have ever filled the wide gaps on ward\\'s shelves at home , and that the meagre so-called \"laboratory\" was the flimsiest sort of a blind . clearly , there were a library and a laboratory elsewhere ; but just where , it was impossible to say . essentially defeated in his quest for something he could not name , willett returned to town before evening and told the senior ward everything which had occurred . they agreed that the youth must be definitely out of his mind , but decided that nothing drastic need be done just then . above all , mrs . ward must be kept in as complete an ignorance as her son\\'s own strange typed notes would permit .\\n\\nmr . ward now determined to call in person upon his son , making it wholly a surprise visit . dr . willett took him in his car one evening , guiding him to within sight of the bungalow and waiting patiently for his return . the session was a long one , and the father emerged in a very saddened and perplexed state . his reception had developed much like willett\\'s , save that charles had been an excessively long time in appearing after the visitor had forced his way into the hall and sent the portuguese away with an imperative demand ; and in the bearing of the altered son there was no trace of filial affection . the lights had been dim , yet even so the youth had complained that they dazzled him outrageously . he had not spoken out loud at all , averring that his throat was in very poor condition ; but in his hoarse whisper there was a quality so vaguely disturbing that mr . ward could not banish it from his mind .\\n\\nnow definitely leagued together to do all they could toward the youth\\'s mental salvation , mr . ward and dr . willett set about collecting every scrap of data which the case might afford . pawtuxet gossip was the first item they studied , and this was relatively easy to glean since both had friends in that region . dr . willett obtained the most rumours because people talked more frankly to him than to a parent of the central figure , and from all he heard he could tell that young ward\\'s life had become indeed a strange one . common tongues would not dissociate his household from the vampirism of the previous summer , while the nocturnal comings and goings of the motor trucks provided their share of dark speculations . local tradesmen spoke of the queerness of the orders brought them by the evil-looking mulatto , and in particular of the inordinate amounts of meat and fresh blood secured from the two butcher shops in the immediate neighbourhood . for a household of only three , these quantities were quite absurd .\\n\\nthen there was the matter of the sounds beneath the earth . reports of these things were harder to pin down , but all the vague hints tallied in certain basic essentials . noises of a ritual nature positively existed , and at times when the bungalow was dark . they might , of course , have come from the known cellar ; but rumour insisted that there were deeper and more spreading crypts . recalling the ancient tales of joseph curwen\\'s catacombs , and assuming for granted that the present bungalow had been selected because of its situation on the old curwen site as revealed in one or another of the documents found behind the picture , willett and mr . ward gave this phase of the gossip much attention ; and searched many times without success for the door in the river-bank which old manuscripts mentioned . as to popular opinions of the bungalow\\'s various inhabitants , it was soon plain that the brava portuguese was loathed , the bearded and spectacled dr . allen feared , and the pallid young scholar disliked to a profound degree . during the last week or two ward had obviously changed much , abandoning his attempts at affability and speaking only in hoarse but oddly repellent whispers on the few occasions that he ventured forth .\\n\\nsuch were the shreds and fragments gathered here and there ; and over these mr . ward and dr . willett held many long and serious conferences . they strove to exercise deduction , induction , and constructive imagination to their utmost extent ; and to correlate every known fact of charles\\'s later life , including the frantic letter which the doctor now shewed the father , with the meagre documentary evidence available concerning old joseph curwen . they would have given much for a glimpse of the papers charles had found , for very clearly the key to the youth\\'s madness lay in what he had learned of the ancient wizard and his doings .\\n\\n4\\n\\nand yet , after all , it was from no step of mr . ward\\'s or dr . willett\\'s that the next move in this singular case proceeded . the father and the physician , rebuffed and confused by a shadow too shapeless and intangible to combat , had rested uneasily on their oars while the typed notes of young ward to his parents grew fewer and fewer . then came the first of the month with its customary financial adjustments , and the clerks at certain banks began a peculiar shaking of heads and telephoning from one to the other . officials who knew charles ward by sight went down to the bungalow to ask why every cheque of his appearing at this juncture was a clumsy forgery , and were reassured less than they ought to have been when the youth hoarsely explained that his hand had lately been so much affected by a nervous shock as to make normal writing impossible . he could , he said , form no written characters at all except with great difficulty ; and could prove it by the fact that he had been forced to type all his recent letters , even those to his father and mother , who would bear out the assertion .\\n\\nwhat made the investigators pause in confusion was not this circumstance alone , for that was nothing unprecedented or fundamentally suspicious , nor even the pawtuxet gossip , of which one or two of them had caught echoes . it was the muddled discourse of the young man which nonplussed them , implying as it did a virtually total loss of memory concerning important monetary matters which he had had at his fingertips only a month or two before . something was wrong ; for despite the apparent coherence and rationality of his speech , there could be no normal reason for this ill-concealed blankness on vital points . moreover , although none of these men knew ward well , they could not help observing the change in his language and manner . they had heard he was an antiquarian , but even the most hopeless antiquarians do not make daily use of obsolete phraseology and gestures . altogether , this combination of hoarseness , palsied hands , bad memory , and altered speech and bearing must represent some disturbance or malady of genuine gravity , which no doubt formed the basis of the prevailing odd rumours ; and after their departure the party of officials decided that a talk with the senior ward was imperative .\\n\\nso on the sixth of march , 1928 , there was a long and serious conference in mr . ward\\'s office , after which the utterly bewildered father summoned dr . willett in a kind of helpless resignation . willett looked over the strained and awkward signatures of the cheque , and compared them in his mind with the penmanship of that last frantic note . certainly , the change was radical and profound , and yet there was something damnably familiar about the new writing . it had crabbed and archaic tendencies of a very curious sort , and seemed to result from a type of stroke utterly different from that which the youth had always used . it was strange--but where had he seen it before ? on the whole , it was obvious that charles was insane . of that there could be no doubt . and since it appeared unlikely that he could handle his property or continue to deal with the outside world much longer , something must quickly be done toward his oversight and possible cure . it was then that the alienists were called in , drs . peck and waite of providence and dr . lyman of boston , to whom mr . ward and dr . willett gave the most exhaustive possible history of the case , and who conferred at length in the now unused library of their young patient , examining what books and papers of his were left in order to gain some further notion of his habitual mental cast . after scanning this material and examining the ominous note to willett they all agreed that charles ward\\'s studies had been enough to unseat or at least to warp any ordinary intellect , and wished most heartily that they could see his more intimate volumes and documents ; but this latter they knew they could do , if at all , only after a scene at the bungalow itself . willett now reviewed the whole case with febrile energy ; it being at this time that he obtained the statements of the workmen who had seen charles find the curwen documents , and that he collated the incidents of the destroyed newspaper items , looking up the latter at the journal office .\\n\\non thursday , the eighth of march , drs . willett , peck , lyman , and waite , accompanied by mr . ward , paid the youth their momentous call ; making no concealment of their object and questioning the now acknowledged patient with extreme minuteness . charles , although he was inordinately long in answering the summons and was still redolent of strange and noxious laboratory odours when he did finally make his agitated appearance , proved a far from recalcitrant subject ; and admitted freely that his memory and balance had suffered somewhat from close application to abstruse studies . he offered no resistance when his removal to other quarters was insisted upon ; and seemed , indeed , to display a high degree of intelligence as apart from mere memory . his conduct would have sent his interviewers away in bafflement had not the persistently archaic trend of his speech and unmistakable replacement of modern by ancient ideas in his consciousness marked him out as one definitely removed from the normal . of his work he would say no more to the group of doctors than he had formerly said to his family and to dr . willett , and his frantic note of the previous month he dismissed as mere nerves and hysteria . he insisted that this shadowy bungalow possessed no library or laboratory beyond the visible ones , and waxed abstruse in explaining the absence from the house of such odours as now saturated all his clothing . neighbourhood gossip he attributed to nothing more than the cheap inventiveness of baffled curiousity . of the whereabouts of dr . allen he said he did not feel at liberty to speak definitely , but assured his inquisitors that the bearded and spectacled man would return when needed . in paying off the stolid brava who resisted all questioning by the visitors , and in closing the bungalow which still seemed to hold such nighted secrets , ward shewed no signs of nervousness save a barely noticed tendency to pause as though listening for something very faint . he was apparently animated by a calmly philosophic resignation , as if he removal were the merest transient incident which would cause the least trouble if facilitated and disposed of once and for all . it was clear that he trusted to his obviously unimpaired keenness of absolute mentality to overcome all the embarrassments into which his twisted memory , his lost voice and handwriting , and his secretive and eccentric behaviour had led him . his mother , it was agreed , was not to be told of the change ; his father supplying typed notes in his name . ward was taken to the restfully and picturesquely situated private hospital maintained by dr . waite on conanicut island in the bay , and subjected to the closest scrutiny and questioning by all the physicians connected with the case . it was then that the physical oddities were noticed ; the slackened metabolism , the altered skin , and the disproportionate neural reactions . dr . willett was the most perturbed of the various examiners , for he had attended ward all his life and could appreciate with terrible keenness the extent of his physical disorganisation . even the familiar olive mark on his hip was gone , while on his chest was a great black mole or cicatrice which had never been there before , and which made willett wonder whether the youth had ever submitted to any of the witch markings reputed to be inflicted at certain unwholesome nocturnal meetings in wild and lonely places . the doctor could not keep his mind off a certain transcribed witch-trial record from salem which charles had shewn him in the old non-secretive days , and which read : \\'mr . g . b . on that nighte putt ye divell his marke upon bridget s . , jonathan a . , simon o . , deliverance w . , joseph c . , susan p . , mehitable c . , and deborah b .\\' ward\\'s face , too , troubled him horribly , till at length he suddenly discovered why he was horrified . for above the young man\\'s right eye was something which he had never previously noticed--a small scar or pit precisely like that in the crumbled painting of old joseph curwen , and perhaps attesting some hideous ritualistic inoculation to which both had submitted at a certain stage of their occult careers .\\n\\nwhile ward himself was puzzling all the doctors at the hospital a very strict watch was kept on all mail addressed either to him or to dr . allen , which mr . ward had ordered delivered at the family home . willett had predicted that very little would be found , since any communications of a vital nature would probably have been exchanged by messenger ; but in the latter part of march there did come a letter from prague for dr . allen which gave both the doctor and the father deep thought . it was in a very crabbed and archaic hand ; and though clearly not the effort of a foreigner , shewed almost as singular a departure from modern english as the speech of young ward himself . it read :\\n\\nkleinstrasse 11 , altstadt , prague , 11th feby . 1928 .\\n\\nbrother in almonsin-metraton :-\\n\\ni this day receiv\\'d yr mention of what came up from the saltes i sent you . it was wrong , and meanes clearly that ye headstones had been chang\\'d when barnabas gott me the specimen . it is often so , as you must be sensible of from the thing you gott from ye kings chapell ground in 1769 and what h . gott from olde bury\\'g point in 1690 , that was like to ende him . i gott such a thing in aegypt 75 yeares gone , from the which came that scar ye boy saw on me here in 1924 . as i told you longe ago , do not calle up that which you can not put downe ;

the old man ward had visited in prague four years previously ? perhaps , but in the centuries behind there had been another simon o .--simon orne , alias jedediah , of salem , who vanished in 1771 , and whose peculiar handwriting dr . willett now unmistakably recognised from the photostatic copies of the orne formulae which charles had once shown him . what horrors and mysteries , what contradictions and contraventions of nature , had come back after a century and a half to harass old providence with her clustered spires and domes ?\\n\\nthe father and the old physician , virtually at a loss what to do or think , went to see charles at the hospital and questioned him as delicately as they could about dr . allen , about the prague visit , and about what he had learned of simon or jedediah orne of salem . to all these enquiries the youth was politely non-committal , merely barking in his hoarse whisper that he had found dr . allen to have a remarkable spiritual rapport with certain souls from the past , and that any correspondent the bearded man might have in prague would probably be similarly gifted . when they left , mr . ward and dr . willett realised to their chagrin that they had really been the ones under catechism ; and that without imparting anything vital himself , the confined youth had adroitly pumped them of everything the prague letter had contained .\\n\\ndrs . peck , waite , and lyman were not inclined to attach much importance to the strange correspondence of young ward\\'s companion ; for they knew the tendency of kindred eccentrics and monomaniacs to band together , and believed that charles or allen had merely unearthed an expatriated counterpart--perhaps one who had seen orne\\'s handwriting and copied it in an attempt to pose as the bygone character\\'s reincarnation . allen himself was perhaps a similar case , and may have persuaded the youth into accepting him as an avatar of the long-dead curwen . such things had been known before , and on the same basis the hard-headed doctors disposed of willett\\'s growing disquiet about charles ward\\'s present handwriting , as studied from unpremeditated specimens obtained by various ruses . willett thought he had placed its odd familiarity at last , and that what it vaguely resembled was the bygone penmanship of old joseph curwen himself ; but this the other physicians regarded as a phase of imitativeness only to be expected in a mania of this sort , and refused to grant it any importance either favourable or unfavourable . recognising this prosaic attitude in his colleagues , willett advised mr . ward to keep to himself the letter which arrived for dr . allen on the second of april from rakus , transylvania , in a handwriting so intensely and fundamentally like that of the hutchinson cipher that both father and physician paused in awe before breaking the seal . this read as follows :\\n\\ncastle ferenczy 7 march 1928 .\\n\\ndear c . :--\\n\\nhadd a squad of 20 militia up to talk about what the country folk say . must digg deeper and have less hearde . these roumanians plague me damnably , being officious and particular where you cou\\'d buy a magyar off with a drinke and food .\\n\\nlast monthe m . got me ye sarcophagus of ye five sphinxes from ye acropolis where he whome i call\\'d up say\\'d it wou\\'d be , and i have hadde 3 talkes with what was therein inhum\\'d . it will go to s . o . in prague directly , and thence to you . it is stubborn but you know ye way with such .\\n\\nyou shew wisdom in having lesse about than before ;

that he was regarding himself as the reincarnation of joseph curwen , and that he entertained--or was at least advised to entertain--murderous designs against a \"boy\" who could scarcely be other than charles ward . there was organised horror afoot ; and no matter who had started it , the missing allen was by this time at the bottom of it . therefore , thanking heaven that charles was now safe in the hospital , mr . ward lost no time in engaging detectives to learn all they could of the cryptic , bearded doctor ; finding whence he had come and what pawtuxet knew of him , and if possible discovering his present whereabouts . supplying the men with one of the bungalow keys which charles yielded up , he urged them to explore allen\\'s vacant room which had been identified when the patient\\'s belongings had been packed ; obtaining what clues they could from any effects he might have left about . mr . ward talked with the detectives in his son\\'s old library , and they felt a marked relief when they left it at last ; for there seemed to hover about the place a vague aura of evil . perhaps it was what they had heard of the infamous old wizard whose picture had once stared from the panelled overmantel , and perhaps it was something different and irrelevant ; but in any case they all half sensed an intangible miasma which centred in that carven vestige of an older dwelling and which at times almost rose to the intensity of a material emanation .\\n\\nv . a nightmare and a cataclysm\\n\\n1\\n\\nand now swiftly followed that hideous experience which has left its indelible mark of fear on the soul of marinus bicknell willett , and has added a decade to the visible age of one whose youth was even then far behind . dr . willett had conferred at length with mr . ward , and had come to an agreement with him on several points which both felt the alienists would ridicule . there was , they conceded , a terrible movement alive in the world , whose direct connexion with a necromancy even older than the salem witchcraft could not be doubted . that at least two living men--and one other of whom they dared not think--were in absolute possession of minds or personalities which had functioned as early as 1690 or before was likewise almost unassailably proved even in the face of all known natural laws . what these horrible creatures--and charles ward as well--were doing or trying to do seemed fairly clear from their letters and from every bit of light both old and new which had filtered in upon the case . they were robbing the tombs of all the ages , including those of the world\\'s wisest and greatest men , in the hope of recovering from the bygone ashes some vestige of the consciousness and lore which had once animated and informed them .\\n\\na hideous traffic was going on among these nightmare ghouls , whereby illustrious bones were bartered with the calm calculativeness of schoolboys swapping books ; and from what was extorted from this centuried dust there was anticipated a power and a wisdom beyond anything which the cosmos had ever seen concentred in one man or group . they had found unholy ways to keep their brains alive , either in the same body or different bodies ; and had evidently achieved a way of tapping the consciousness of the dead whom they gathered together . there had , it seems , been some truth in chimerical old borellus when he wrote of preparing from even the most antique remains certain \"essential saltes\" from which the shade of a long-dead living thing might be raised up . there was a formula for evoking such a shade , and another for putting it down ; and it had now been so perfected that it could be taught successfully . one must be careful about evocations , for the markers of old graves are not always accurate .\\n\\nwillett and mr . ward shivered as they passed from conclusion to conclusion . things--presences or voices of some sort--could be drawn down from unknown places as well as from the grave , and in this process also one must be careful . joseph curwen had indubitably evoked many forbidden things , and as for charles--what might one think of him ? what forces \"outside the spheres\" had reached him from joseph curwen\\'s day and turned his mind on forgotten things ? he had been led to find certain directions , and he had used them . he had talked with the man of horror in prague and stayed long with the creature in the mountains of transylvania . and he must have found the grave of joseph curwen at last . that newspaper item and what his mother had heard in the night were too significant to overlook . then he had summoned something , and it must have come . that mighty voice aloft on good friday , and those different tones in the locked attic laboratory . what were they like , with their depth and hollowness ? was there not here some awful foreshadowing of the dreaded stranger dr . allen with his spectral bass ? yes , that was what mr . ward had felt with vague horror in his single talk with the man--if man it were--over the telephone !\\n\\nwhat hellish consciousness or voice , what morbid shade or presence , had come to answer charles ward\\'s secret rites behind that locked door ? those voices heard in argument--\"must have it red for three months\"--good god ! was not that just before the vampirism broke out ? the rifling of ezra weeden\\'s ancient grave , and the cries later at pawtuxet--whose mind had planned the vengeance and rediscovered the shunned seat of elder blasphemies ? and then the bungalow and the bearded stranger , and the gossip , and the fear . the final madness of charles neither father nor doctor could attempt to explain , but they did feel sure that the mind of joseph curwen had come to earth again and was following its ancient morbidities . was daemoniac possession in truth a possibility ? allen had something to do with it , and the detectives must find out more about one whose existence menaced the young man\\'s life . in the meantime , since the existence of some vast crypt beneath the bungalow seemed virtually beyond dispute , some effort must be made to find it . willett and mr . ward , conscious of the sceptical attitude of the alienists , resolved during their final conference to undertake a joint secret exploration of unparalleled thoroughness ; and agreed to meet at the bungalow on the following morning with valises and with certain tools and accessories suited to architectural search and underground exploration .\\n\\nthe morning of april 6th dawned clear , and both explorers were at the bungalow by ten o\\'clock . mr . ward had the key , and an entry and cursory survey were made . from the disordered condition of dr . allen\\'s room it was obvious that the detectives had been there before , and the later searchers hoped that they had found some clue which might prove of value . of course the main business lay in the cellar ; so thither they descended without much delay , again making the circuit which each had vainly made before in the presence of the mad young owner . for a time everything seemed baffling , each inch of the earthen floor and stone walls having so solid and innocuous an aspect that the thought of a yawning aperture was scarcely to be entertained . willett reflected that since the original cellar was dug without knowledge of any catacombs beneath , the beginning of the passage would represent the strictly modern delving of young ward and his associates , where they had probed for the ancient vaults whose rumour could have reached them by no wholesome means .\\n\\nthe doctor tried to put himself in charles\\'s place to see how a delver would be likely to start , but could not gain much inspiration from this method . then he decided on elimination as a policy , and went carefully over the whole subterranean surface both vertical and horizontal , trying to account for every inch separately . he was soon substantially narrowed down , and at last had nothing left but the small platform before the washtubs , which he tried once before in vain . now experimenting in every possible way , and exerting a double strength , he finally found that the top did indeed turn and slide horizontally on a corner pivot . beneath it lay a trim concrete surface with an iron manhole , to which mr . ward at once rushed with excited zeal . the cover was not hard to lift , and the father had quite removed it when willett noticed the queerness of his aspect . he was swaying and nodding dizzily , and in the gust of noxious air which swept up from the black pit beneath the doctor soon recognised ample cause .\\n\\nin a moment dr . willett had his fainting companion on the floor above and was reviving him with cold water . mr . ward responded feebly , but it could be seen that the mephitic blast from the crypt had in some way gravely sickened him . wishing to take no chances , willett hastened out to broad street for a taxicab and had soon dispatched the sufferer home despite his weak-voiced protests ; after which he produced an electric torch , covered his nostrils with a band of sterile gauze , and descended once more to peer into the new-found depths . the foul air had now slightly abated , and willett was able to send a beam of light down the stygian hold . for about ten feet , he saw , it was a sheer cylindrical drop with concrete walls and an iron ladder ; after which the hole appeared to strike a flight of old stone steps which must originally have emerged to earth somewhat southwest of the present building .\\n\\n2\\n\\nwillett freely admits that for a moment the memory of the old curwen legends kept him from climbing down alone into that malodorous gulf . he could not help thinking of what luke fenner had reported on that last monstrous night . then duty asserted itself and he made the plunge , carrying a great valise for the removal of whatever papers might prove of supreme importance . slowly , as befitted one of his years , he descended the ladder and reached the slimy steps below . this was ancient masonry , his torch told him ; and upon the dripping walls he saw the unwholesome moss of centuries . down , down , ran the steps ; not spirally , but in three abrupt turns ; and with such narrowness that two men could have passed only with difficulty . he had counted about thirty when a sound reached him very faintly ; and after that he did not feel disposed to count any more .\\n\\nit was a godless sound ; one of those low-keyed , insidious outrages of nature which are not meant to be . to call it a dull wail , a doom-dragged whine , or a hopeless howl of chorused anguish and stricken flesh without mind would be to miss its quintessential loathsomeness and soul-sickening overtones . was it for this that ward had seemed to listen on that day he was removed ? it was the most shocking thing that willett had ever heard , and it continued from no determinate point as the doctor reached the bottom of the steps and cast his torchlight around on lofty corridor walls surmounted by cyclopean vaulting and pierced by numberless black archways . the hall in which he stood was perhaps fourteen feet high in the middle of the vaulting and ten or twelve feet broad . its pavement was of large chipped flagstone , and its walls and roof were of dressed masonry . its length he could not imagine , for it stretched ahead indefinitely into the blackness . of the archways , some had doors of the old six-panelled colonial type , whilst others had none .\\n\\novercoming the dread induced by the smell and the howling , willett began to explore these archways one by one ; finding beyond them rooms with groined stone ceilings , each of medium size and apparently of bizarre uses . most of them had fireplaces , the upper courses of whose chimneys would have formed an interesting study in engineering . never before or since had he seen such instruments or suggestions of instruments as here loomed up on every hand through the burying dust and cobwebs of a century and a half , in many cases evidently shattered as if by the ancient raiders . for many of the chambers seemed wholly untrodden by modern feet , and must have represented the earliest and most obsolete phases of joseph curwen\\'s experimentation . finally there came a room of obvious modernity , or at least of recent occupancy . there were oil heaters , bookshelves and tables , chairs and cabinets , and a desk piled high with papers of varying antiquity and contemporaneousness . candlesticks and oil lamps stood about in several places ; and finding a match-safe handy , willett lighted such as were ready for use .\\n\\nin the fuller gleam it appeared that this apartment was nothing less than the latest study or library of charles ward . of the books the doctor had seen many before , and a good part of the furniture had plainly come from the prospect street mansion . here and there was a piece well known to willett , and the sense of familiarity became so great that he half forgot the noisomness and the wailing , both of which were plainer here than they had been at the foot of the steps . his first duty , as planned long ahead , was to find and seize any papers which might seem of vital importance ; especially those portentous documents found by charles so long ago behind the picture in olney court . as he search he perceived how stupendous a task the final unravelling would be ; for file on file was stuffed with papers in curious hands and bearing curious designs , so that months or even years might be needed for a thorough deciphering and editing . once he found three large packets of letters with prague and rakus postmarks , and in writing clearly recognisable as orne\\'s and hutchinson\\'s ; all of which he took with him as part of the bundle to be removed in his valise .\\n\\nat last , in a locked mahogany cabinet once gracing the ward home , willett found the batch of old curwen papers ; recognising them from the reluctant glimpse charles had granted him so many years ago . the youth had evidently kept them together very much as they had been when first he found them , since all the titles recalled by the workmen were present except the papers addressed to orne and hutchinson , and the cipher with its key . willett placed the entire lot in his valise and continued his examination of the files . since young ward\\'s immediate condition was the greatest matter at stake , the closest searching was done among the most obviously recent matter ; and in this abundance of contemporary manuscript one very baffling oddity was noted . the oddity was the slight amount in charles\\'s normal writing , which indeed included nothing more recent than two months before . on the other hand , there were literally reams of symbols and formulae , historical notes and philosophical comment , in a crabbed penmanship absolutely identical with the ancient script of joseph curwen , though of undeniably modern dating . plainly , a part of the latter-day programme had been a sedulous imitation of the old wizard\\'s writing , which charles seemed to have carried to a marvellous state of perfection . of any third hand which might have been allen\\'s there was not a trace . if he had indeed come to be the leader , he must have forced young ward to act as his amanuensis .\\n\\nin this new material one mystic formula , or rather pair of formulae , recurred so often that willett had it by heart before he had half finished his quest . it consisted of two parallel columns , the left-hand one surmounted by the archaic symbol called \"dragon\\'s head\" and used in almanacs to indicate the ascending node , and the right-hand one headed by a corresponding sign of \"dragon\\'s tail\" or descending node . the appearance of the whole was something like this , and almost unconsciously the doctor realised that the second half was no more than the first written syllabically backward with the exception of the final monosyllables and of the odd name yog-sothoth , which he had come to recognise under various spellings from other things he had seen in connexion with this horrible matter . the formulae were as follows--exactly so , as willett is abundantly able to testify--and the first one struck an odd note of uncomfortable latent memory in his brain , which he recognised later when reviewing the events of that horrible good friday of the previous year .\\n\\ny\\'ai \\'ng\\'ngah , yog-sothoth h\\'ee-l\\'geb f\\'ai throdog uaaah\\n\\nogthrod ai\\'f geb\\'l-ee\\'h yog-sothoth \\'ngah\\'ng ai\\'y zhro\\n\\nso haunting were these formulae , and so frequently did he come upon them , that before the doctor knew it he was repeating them under his breath . eventually , however , he felt he had secured all the papers he could digest to advantage for the present ; hence resolved to examine no more till he could bring the sceptical alienists en masse for an ampler and more systematic raid . he had still to find the hidden laboratory , so leaving his valise in the lighted room he emerged again into the black noisome corridor whose vaulting echoed ceaseless with that dull and hideous whine .\\n\\nthe next few rooms he tried were all abandoned , or filled only with crumbling boxes and ominous-looking leaden coffins ; but impressed him deeply with the magnitude of joseph curwen\\'s original operations . he thought of the slaves and seamen who had disappeared , of the graves which had been violated in every part of the world , and of what that final raiding party must have seen ; and then he decided it was better not to think any more . once a great stone staircase mounted at his right , and he deduced that this must have reached to one of the curwen outbuildings--perhaps the famous stone edifice with the high slit-like windows--provided the steps he had descended had led from the steep-roofed farmhouse . suddenly the walls seemed to fall away ahead , and the stench and the wailing grew stronger . willett saw that he had come upon a vast open space , so great that his torchlight would not carry across it ; and as he advanced he encountered occasional stout pillars supporting the arches of the roof .\\n\\nafter a time he reached a circle of pillars grouped like the monoliths of stonehenge , with a large carved altar on a base of three steps in the centre ; and so curious were the carvings on that altar that he approached to study them with his electric light . but when he saw what they were he shrank away shuddering , and did not stop to investigate the dark stains which discoloured the upper surface and had spread down the sides in occasional thin lines . instead , he found the distant wall and traced it as it swept round in a gigantic circle perforated by occasional black doorways and indented by a myriad of shallow cells with iron gratings and wrist and ankle bonds on chains fastened to the stone of the concave rear masonry . these cells were empty , but still the horrible odour and the dismal moaning continued , more insistent now than ever , and seemingly varied at time by a sort of slippery thumping .\\n\\n3\\n\\nfrom that frightful smell and that uncanny noise willett\\'s attention could no longer be diverted . both were plainer and more hideous in the great pillared hall than anywhere else , and carried a vague impression of being far below , even in this dark nether world of subterrene mystery . before trying any of the black archways for steps leading further down , the doctor cast his beam of light about the stone-flagged floor . it was very loosely paved , and at irregular intervals there would occur a slab curiously pierced by small holes in no definite arrangement , while at one point there lay a very long ladder carelessly flung down . to this ladder , singularly enough , appeared to cling a particularly large amount of the frightful odour which encompassed everything . as he walked slowly about it suddenly occurred to willett that both the noise and the odour seemed strongest above the oddly pierced slabs , as if they might be crude trap-doors leading down to some still deeper region of horror . kneeling by one , he worked at it with his hands , and found that with extreme difficulty he could budge it . at his touch the moaning beneath ascended to a louder key , and only with vast trepidation did he persevere in the lifting of the heavy stone . a stench unnameable now rose up from below , and the doctor\\'s head reeled dizzily as he laid back the slab and turned his torch upon the exposed square yard of gaping blackness .\\n\\nif he had expected a flight of steps to some wide gulf of ultimate abomination , willett was destined to be disappointed ; for amidst that foetor and cracked whining he discerned only the brick-faced top of a cylindrical well perhaps a yard and a half in diameter and devoid of any ladder or other means of descent . as the light shone down , the wailing changed suddenly to a series of horrible yelps ; in conjunction with which there came again that sound of blind , futile scrambling and slippery thumping . the explorer trembled , unwilling even to imagine what noxious thing might be lurking in that abyss , but in a moment mustered up the courage to peer over the rough-hewn brink ; lying at full length and holding the torch downward at arm\\'s length to see what might lie below . for a second he could distinguish nothing but the slimy , moss-grown brick walls sinking illimitably into that half-tangible miasma of murk and foulness and anguished frenzy ; and then he saw that something dark was leaping clumsily and frantically up and down at the bottom of the narrow shaft , which must have been from twenty to twenty-five feet below the stone floor where he lay . the torch shook in his hand , but he looked again to see what manner of living creature might be immured there in the darkness of that unnatural well ; left starving by young ward through all the long month since the doctors had taken him away , and clearly only one of a vast number prisoned in the kindred wells whose pierced stone covers so thickly studded the floor of the great vaulted cavern . whatever the things were , they could not lie down in their cramped spaces ; but must have crouched and whined and waited and feebly leaped all those hideous weeks since their master had abandoned them unheeded .\\n\\nbut marinus bicknell willett was sorry that he looked again ; for surgeon and veteran of the dissecting-room though he was , he has not been the same since . it is hard to explain just how a single sight of a tangible object with measurable dimensions could so shake and change a man ; and we may only say that there is about certain outlines and entities a power of symbolism and suggestion which acts frightfully on a sensitive thinker\\'s perspective and whispers terrible hints of obscure cosmic relationships and unnameable realities behind the protective illusions of common vision . in that second look willett saw such an outline or entity , for during the next few instants he was undoubtedly as stark raving mad as any inmate of dr . waite\\'s private hospital . he dropped the electric torch from a hand drained of muscular power or nervous co\\xc3\\xb6rdination , nor heeded the sound of crunching teeth which told of its fate at the bottom of the pit . he screamed and screamed and screamed in a voice whose falsetto panic no acquaintance of his would ever have recognised ; and though he could not rise to his feet he crawled and rolled desperately away from the damp pavement where dozens of tartarean wells poured forth their exhausted whining and yelping to answer his own insane cries . he tore his hands on the rough , loose stones , and many times bruised his head against the frequent pillars , but still he kept on . then at last he slowly came to himself in the utter blackness and stench , and stopped his ears against the droning wail into which the burst of yelping had subsided . he was drenched with perspiration and without means of producing a light ; stricken and unnerved in the abysmal blackness and horror , and crushed with a memory he never could efface . beneath him dozens of those things still lived , and from one of those shafts the cover was removed . he knew that what he had seen could never climb up the slippery walls , yet shuddered at the thought that some obscure foot-hold might exist .\\n\\nwhat the thing was , he would never tell . it was like some of the carvings on the hellish altar , but it was alive . nature had never made it in this form , for it was too palpably unfinished . the deficiencies were of the most surprising sort , and the abnormalities of proportion could not be described . willett consents only to say that this type of thing must have represented entities which ward called up from imperfect salts , and which he kept for servile or ritualistic purposes . if it had not had a certain significance , its image would not have been carved on that damnable stone . it was not the worst thing depicted on that stone--but willett never opened the other pits . at the time , the first connected idea in his mind was an idle paragraph from some of the old curwen data he had digested long before ; a phrase used by simon or jedediah orne in that portentous confiscated letter to the bygone sorcerer :\\n\\n\\'certainely , there was noth\\'g but ye liveliest awfulness in that which h . rais\\'d upp from what he cou\\'d gather onlie a part of .\\'\\n\\nthen , horribly supplementing rather than displacing this image , there came a recollection of those ancient lingering rumours anent the burned , twisted thing found in the fields a week after the curwen raid . charles ward had once told the doctor what old slocum said of that object ; that it was neither thoroughly human , nor wholly allied to any animal which pawtuxet folk had ever seen or read about .\\n\\nthese words hummed in the doctor\\'s mind as he rocked to and fro , squatting on the nitrous stone floor . he tried to drive them out , and repeated the lord\\'s prayer to himself ; eventually trailing off into a mnemonic hodge-podge like the modernistic waste land of mr . t . s . eliot , and finally reverting to the oft-repeated dual formula he had lately found in ward\\'s underground library : \\'y\\'ai \\'ng\\'ngah , yog-sothoth\\' and so on till the final underlined zhro .\\n\\nit seemed to soothe him , and he staggered to his feet after a time ; lamenting bitterly his fright-lost torch and looking wildly about for any gleam of light in the clutching inkiness of the chilly air . think he would not ; but he strained his eyes in every direction for some faint glint or reflection of the bright illumination he had left in the library . after a while he thought he detected a suspicion of a glow infinitely far away , and toward this he crawled in agonised caution on hands and knees amidst the stench and howling , always feeling ahead lest he collide with the numerous great pillars or stumble into the abominable pit he had uncovered .\\n\\nonce his shaking fingers touched something which he knew must be the steps leading to the hellish altar , and from this spot he recoiled in loathing . at another time he encountered the pierced slab he had removed , and here his caution became almost pitiful . but he did not come upon the dread aperture after all , nor did anything issue from that aperture to detain him . what had been down there made no sound nor stir . evidently its crunching of the fallen electric torch had not been good for it . each time willett\\'s fingers felt a perforated slab he trembled . his passage over it would sometimes increase the groaning below , but generally it would produce no effect at all , since he moved very noiselessly . several times during his progress the glow ahead diminished perceptibly , and he realised that the various candles and lamps he had left must be expiring one by one . the thought of being lost in utter darkness without matches amidst this underground world of nightmare labyrinths impelled him to rise to his feet and run , which he could safely do now that he had passed the open pit ; for he knew that once the light failed , his only hope of rescue and survival would lie in whatever relief party mr . ward might send after missing him for a sufficient period . presently , however , he emerged from the open space into the narrower corridor and definitely located the glow as coming from a door on his right . in a moment he had reached it and was standing once more in young ward\\'s secret library , trembling with relief , and watching the sputterings of that last lamp which had brought him to safety .\\n\\n4\\n\\nin another moment he was hastily filling the burned-out lamps from an oil supply he had previously noticed , and when the room was bright again he looked about to see if he might find a lantern for further exploration . for racked though he was with horror , his sense of grim purpose was still uppermost ; and he was firmly determined to leave no stone unturned in his search for the hideous facts behind charles ward\\'s bizarre madness . failing to find a lantern , he chose the smallest of the lamps to carry ; also filling his pockets with candles and matches , and taking with him a gallon can of oil , which he proposed to keep for reserve use in whatever hidden laboratory he might uncover beyond the terrible open space with its unclean altar and nameless covered wells . to traverse that space again would require his utmost fortitude , but he knew it must be done . fortunately neither the frightful altar nor the opened shaft was near the vast cell-indented wall which bounded the cavern area , and whose black mysterious archways would form the next goals of a logical search .\\n\\nso willett went back to that great pillared hall of stench and anguished howling ; turning down his lamp to avoid any distant glimpse of the hellish altar , or of the uncovered pit with the pierced stone slab beside it . most of the black doorways led merely to small chambers , some vacant and some evidently used as storerooms ; and in several of the latter he saw some very curious accumulations of various objects . one was packed with rotting and dust-draped bales of spare clothing , and the explorer thrilled when he saw that it was unmistakably the clothing of a century and a half before . in another room he found numerous odds and ends of modern clothing , as if gradual provisions were being made to equip a large body of men . but what he disliked most of all were the huge copper vats which occasionally appeared ; these , and the sinister incrustations upon them . he liked them even less than the weirdly figured leaden bowls whose rims retained such obnoxious deposits and around which clung repellent odours perceptible above even the general noisomness of the crypt . when he had completed about half the entire circuit of the wall he found another corridor like that from which he had come , and out of which many doors opened . this he proceeded to investigate ; and after entering three rooms of medium size and of no significant contents , he came at last to a large oblong apartment whose business-like tanks and tables , furnaces and modern instruments , occasional books and endless shelves of jars and bottles proclaimed it indeed the long-sought laboratory of charles ward--and no doubt of old joseph curwen before him .\\n\\nafter lighting the three lamps which he found filled and ready , dr . willett examined the place and all the appurtenances with the keenest interest ; noting from the relative quantities of various reagents on the shelves that young ward\\'s dominant concern must have been with some branch of organic chemistry . on the whole , little could be learned from the scientific ensemble , which included a gruesome-looking dissecting-table ; so that the room was really rather a disappointment . among the books was a tattered old copy of borellus in black-letter , and it was weirdly interesting to note that ward had underlined the same passage whose marking had so perturbed good mr . merritt in curwen\\'s farmhouse more than a century and half before . that old copy , of course , must have perished along with the rest of curwen\\'s occult library in the final raid . three archways opened off the laboratory , and these the doctor proceeded to sample in turn . from his cursory survey he saw that two led merely to small storerooms ; but these he canvassed with care , remarking the piles of coffins in various stages of damage and shuddering violently at two or three of the few coffin-plates he could decipher . there was much clothing also stored in these rooms , and several new and tightly nailed boxes which he did not stop to investigate . most interesting of all , perhaps , were some odd bits which he judged to be fragments of old joseph curwen\\'s laboratory appliances . these had suffered damage at the hands of the raiders , but were still partly recognisable as the chemical paraphernalia of the georgian period .\\n\\nthe third archway led to a very sizeable chamber entirely lined with shelves and having in the centre a table bearing two lamps . these lamps willett lighted , and in their brilliant glow studied the endless shelving which surrounded him . some of the upper levels were wholly vacant , but most of the space was filled with small odd-looking leaden jars of two general types ; one tall and without handles like a grecian lekythos or oil-jug , and the other with a single handle and proportioned like a phaleron jug . all had metal stoppers , and were covered with peculiar-looking symbols moulded in low relief . in a moment the doctor noticed that these jugs were classified with great rigidity ; all the lekythoi being on one side of the room with a large wooden sign reading \\'custodes\\' above them , and all the phalerons on the other , correspondingly labelled with a sign reading \\'materia\\' .\\n\\neach of the jars of jugs , except some on the upper shelves that turned out to be vacant , bore a cardboard tag with a number apparently referring to a catalogue ; and willett resolved to look for the latter presently . for the moment , however , he was more interested in the nature of the array as a whole , and experimentally opened several of the lekythoi and phalerons at random with a view to a rough generalisation . the result was invariable . both types of jar contained a small quantity of a single kind of substance ; a fine dusty powder of very light weight and of many shades of dull , neutral colour . to the colours which formed the only point of variation there was no apparent method of disposal ; and no distinction between what occurred in the lekythoi and what occurred in the phalerons . a bluish-grey powder might be by the side of a pinkish-white one , and any one in a phaleron might have its exact counterpart in a lekythos . the most individual feature about the powders was their non-adhesiveness . willett would pour one into his hand , and upon returning it to its jug would find that no residue whatever remained on his palm .\\n\\nthe meaning of the two signs puzzled him , and he wondered why this battery of chemicals was separated so radically from those in glass jars on the shelves of the laboratory proper . \"custodes\" , \"materia\" ; that was the latin for \"guards\" and \"materials\" , respectively--and then there came a flash of memory as to where he had seen that word \"guards\" before in connexion with this dreadful mystery . it was , of course , in the recent letter to dr . allen purporting to be from old edwin hutchinson ; and the phrase had read : \\'there was no neede to keep the guards in shape and eat\\'g off their heads , and it made much to be founde in case of trouble , as you too welle knowe .\\' what did this signify ? but wait--was there not still another reference to \"guards\" in this matter which he had failed wholly to recall when reading the hutchinson letter ? back in the old non-secretive days ward had told him of the eleazar smith diary recording the spying of smith and weeden on the curwen farm , and in that dreadful chronicle there had been a mention of conversations overheard before the old wizard betook himself wholly beneath the earth . there had been , smith and weeden insisted , terrible colloquies wherein figured curwen , certain captives of his , and the guards of those captives . those guards , according to hutchinson or his avatar , had \"eaten their heads off\" , so that now dr . allen did not keep them in shape . and if not in shape , how save as the \"salts\" to which it appears this wizard band was engaged in reducing as many human bodies or skeletons as they could ?\\n\\nso that was what these lekythoi contained ; the monstrous fruit of unhallowed rites and deeds , presumably won or cowed to such submission as to help , when called up by some hellish incantation , in the defence of their blasphemous master or the questioning of those who were not so willing ? willett shuddered at the thought of what he had been pouring in and out of his hands , and for a moment felt an impulse to flee in panic from that cavern of hideous shelves with their silent and perhaps watching sentinels . then he thought of the \"materia\"--in the myriad phaleron jugs on the other side of the room . salts too--and if not the salts of \"guards\" , then the salts of what ? god ! could it be possible that here lay the mortal relics of half the titan thinkers of all the ages ; snatched by supreme ghouls from crypts where the world thought them safe , and subject to the beck and call of madmen who sought to drain their knowledge for some still wilder end whose ultimate effect would concern , as poor charles had hinted in his frantic note , \"all civilisation , all natural law , perhaps even the fate of the solar system and the universe\" ? and marinus bicknell willett had sifted their dust through his hands !\\n\\nthen he noticed a small door at the further end of the room , and calmed himself enough to approach it and examine the crude sign chiselled above . it was only a symbol , but it filled him with vague spiritual dread ; for a morbid , dreaming friend of his had once drawn it on paper and told him a few of the things it means in the dark abyss of sleep . it was the sign of koth , that dreamers see fixed above the archway of a certain black tower standing alone in twilight--and willett did not like what his friend randolph carter had said of its powers . but a moment later he forgot the sign as he recognised a new acrid odour in the stench-filled air . this was a chemical rather than animal smell , and came clearly from the room beyond the door . and it was , unmistakably , the same odour which had saturated charles ward\\'s clothing on the day the doctors had taken him away . so it was here that the youth had been interrupted by the final summons ? he was wiser that old joseph curwen , for he had not resisted . willett , boldly determined to penetrate every wonder and nightmare this nether realm might contain , seized the small lamp and crossed the threshold . a wave of nameless fright rolled out to meet him , but he yielded to no whim and deferred to no intuition . there was nothing alive here to harm him , and he would not be stayed in his piercing of the eldritch cloud which engulfed his patient .\\n\\nthe room beyond the door was of medium size , and had no furniture save a table , a single chair , and two groups of curious machines with clamps and wheels , which willett recognised after a moment as mediaeval instruments of torture . on one side of the door stood a rack of savage whips , above which were some shelves bearing empty rows of shallow pedestalled cups of lead shaped like grecian kylikes . on the other side was the table ; with a powerful argand lamp , a pad and pencil , and two of the stoppered lekythoi from the shelves outside set down at irregular places as if temporarily or in haste . willett lighted the lamp and looked carefully at the pad , to see what notes ward might have been jotting down when interrupted ; but found nothing more intelligible than the following disjointed fragments in that crabbed curwen chirography , which shed no light on the case as a whole :\\n\\n\\'b . dy\\'d not . escap\\'d into walls and founde place below .\\' \\'sawe olde v . saye ye sabaoth and learnt yee way .\\' \\'rais\\'d yog-sothoth thrice and was ye nexte day deliver\\'d .\\' \\'f . soughte to wipe out all know\\'g howe to raise those from outside .\\'\\n\\nas the strong argand blaze lit up the entire chamber the doctor saw that the wall opposite the door , between the two groups of torturing appliances in the corners , was covered with pegs from which hung a set of shapeless-looking robes of a rather dismal yellowish-white . but far more interesting were the two vacant walls , both of which were thickly covered with mystic symbols and formulae roughly chiselled in the smooth dressed stone . the damp floor also bore marks of carving ; and with but little difficulty willett deciphered a huge pentagram in the centre , with a plain circle about three feet wide half way between this and each corner . in one of these four circles , near where a yellowish robe had been flung carelessly down , there stood a shallow kylix of the sort found on the shelves above the whip-rack ; and just outside the periphery was one of the phaleron jugs from the shelves in the other room , its tag numbered 118 . this was unstoppered , and proved upon inspection to be empty ; but the explorer saw with a shiver that the kylix was not . within its shallow area , and saved from scattering only by the absence of wind in this sequestered cavern , lay a small amount of a dry , dull-greenish efflorescent powder which must have belonged in the jug ; and willett almost reeled at the implications that came sweeping over him as he correlated little by little the several elements and antecedents of the scene . the whips and the instruments of torture , the dust or salts from the jug of \"materia\" , the two lekythoi from the \"custodes\" shelf , the robes , the formulae on the walls , the notes on the pad , the hints from letters and legends , and the thousand glimpses , doubts , and suppositions which had come to torment the friends and parents of charles ward--all these engulfed the doctor in a tidal wave of horror as he looked at that dry greenish powder outspread in the pedestalled leaden kylix on the floor .\\n\\nwith an effort , however , willett pulled himself together and began studying the formulae chiselled on the walls . from the stained and incrusted letters it was obvious that they were carved in joseph curwen\\'s time , and their text was such as to be vaguely familiar to one who had read much curwen material or delved extensively into the history of magic . one the doctor clearly recognised as what mrs . ward heard her son chanting on that ominous good friday a year before , and what an authority had told him was a very terrible invocation addressed to secret gods outside the normal spheres . it was not spelled here exactly as mrs . ward had set it down from memory , nor yet as the authority had shewn it to him in the forbidden pages of \"eliphas levi\" ; but its identity was unmistakable , and such words as sabaoth , metraton , almousin , and zariatnatmik sent a shudder of fright through the search who had seen and felt so much of cosmic abomination just around the corner .\\n\\nthis was on the left-hand wall as one entered the room . the right-hand wall was no less thickly inscribed , and willett felt a start of recognition when he came up the pair of formulae so frequently occurring in the recent notes in the library . they were , roughly speaking , the same ; with the ancient symbols of \"dragon\\'s head\" and \"dragon\\'s tail\" heading them as in ward\\'s scribblings . but the spelling differed quite widely from that of the modern versions , as if old curwen had had a different way of recording sound , or as if later study had evolved more powerful and perfected variants of the invocations in question . the doctor tried to reconcile the chiselled version with the one which still ran persistently in his head , and found it hard to do . where the script he had memorised began \"y\\'ai \\'ng\\'ngah , yog-sothoth\" , this epigraph started out as \"aye , engengah , yogge-sothotha\" ; which to his mind would seriously interfere with the syllabification of the second word .\\n\\nground as the later text was into his consciousness , the discrepancy disturbed him ; and he found himself chanting the first of the formulae aloud in an effort to square the sound he conceived with the letters he found carved . weird and menacing in that abyss of antique blasphemy rang his voice ; its accents keyed to a droning sing-song either through the spell of the past and the unknown , or through the hellish example of that dull , godless wail from the pits whose inhuman cadences rose and fell rhythmically in the distance through the stench and the darkness .\\n\\ny\\'ai \\'ng\\'ngah , yog-sothoth h\\'ee-l\\'geb f\\'ai throdog uaaah !\\n\\nbut what was this cold wind which had sprung into life at the very outset of the chant ? the lamps were sputtering woefully , and the gloom grew so dense that the letters on the wall nearly faded from sight . there was smoke , too , and an acrid odour which quite drowned out the stench from the far-away wells ; an odour like that he had smelt before , yet infinitely stronger and more pungent . he turned from the inscriptions to face the room with its bizarre contents , and saw that the kylix on the floor , in which the ominous efflorescent powder had lain , was giving forth a cloud of thick , greenish-black vapour of surprising volume and opacity . that powder--great god ! it had come from the shelf of \"materia\"--what was it doing now , and what had started it ? the formula he had been chanting--the first of the pair--dragon\\'s head , ascending node--blessed saviour , could it be  . . .\\n\\nthe doctor reeled , and through his head raced wildly disjointed scraps from all he had seen , heard , and read of the frightful case of joseph curwen and charles dexter ward . \"i say to you againe , doe not call up any that you can not put downe . . .have ye wordes for laying at all times readie , and stopp not to be sure when there is any doubte of whom you have . . .3 talkes with what was therein inhum\\'d  . . .\" mercy of heaven , what is that shape behind the parting smoke ?\\n\\n5\\n\\nmarinus bicknell willett has not hope that any part of his tale will be believed except by certain sympathetic friends , hence he has made no attempt to tell it beyond his most intimate circle . only a few outsiders have ever heard it repeated , and of these the majority laugh and remark that the doctor surely is getting old . he has been advised to take a long vacation and to shun future cases dealing with mental disturbance . but mr . ward knows that the veteran physician speaks only a horrible truth . did not he himself see the noisome aperture in the bungalow cellar ? did not willett send him home overcome and ill at eleven o\\'clock that portentous morning ? did he not telephone the doctor in vain that evening , and again the next day , and had he not driven to the bungalow itself on that following noon , finding his friend unconscious but unharmed on one of the beds upstairs ? willett had been breathing stertorously , and opened his eyes slowly when mr . ward gave him some brandy fetched from the car . then he shuddered and screamed , crying out , \\'that beard . . .those eyes . . .god , who are you ?\\' a very strange thing to say to a trim , blue-eyed , clean-shaven gentleman whom he had known from the latter\\'s boyhood .\\n\\nin the bright noon sunlight the bungalow was unchanged since the previous morning . willett\\'s clothing bore no disarrangement beyond certain smudges and worn places at the knees , and only a faint acrid odour reminded mr . ward of what he had smelt on his son that day he was taken to the hospital . the doctor\\'s flashlight was missing , but his valise was safely there , as empty as when he had brought it . before indulging in any explanations , and obviously with great moral effort , willett staggered dizzily down to the cellar and tried the fateful platform before the tubs . it was unyielding . crossing to where he had left his yet unused tool satchel the day before , he obtained a chisel and began to pry up the stubborn planks one by one . underneath the smooth concrete was still visible , but of any opening or perforation there was no longer a trace . nothing yawned this time to sicken the mystified father who had followed the doctor downstairs ; only the smooth concrete underneath the planks--no noisome well , no world of subterrene horrors , no secret library , no curwen papers , no nightmare pits of stench and howling , no laboratory or shelves or chiselled formulae , no . . .dr . willett turned pale , and clutched at the younger man . \\'yesterday ,\\' he asked softly , \\'did you see it here . . .and smell it ?\\' and when mr . ward , himself transfixed with dread and wonder , found strength to nod an affirmative , the physician gave a sound half a sigh and half a gasp , and nodded in turn . \\'then i will tell you\\' , he said .\\n\\nso for an hour , in the sunniest room they could find upstairs , the physician whispered his frightful tale to the wondering father . there was nothing to relate beyond the looming up of that form when the greenish-black vapour from the kylix parted , and willett was too tired to ask himself what had really occurred . there were futile , bewildered head-shakings from both men , and once mr . ward ventured a hushed suggestion , \\'do you suppose it would be of any use to dig ?\\' the doctor was silent , for it seemed hardly fitting for any human brain to answer when powers of unknown spheres had so vitally encroached on this side of the great abyss . again mr . ward asked , \\'but where did it go ? it brought you here , you know , and it sealed up the hole somehow .\\' and willett again let silence answer for him .\\n\\nbut after all , this was not the final phase of the matter . reaching for his handkerchief before rising to leave , dr . willett\\'s fingers closed upon a piece of paper in his pocket which had not been there before , and which was companioned by the candles and matches he had seized in the vanished vault . it was a common sheet , torn obviously from the cheap pad in that fabulous room of horror somewhere underground , and the writing upon it was that of an ordinary lead pencil--doubtless the one which had lain beside the pad . it was folded very carelessly , and beyond the faint acrid scent of the cryptic chamber bore no print or mark of any world but this . but in the text itself it did indeed reek with wonder ; for here was no script of any wholesome age , but the laboured strokes of mediaeval darkness , scarcely legible to the laymen who now strained over it , yet having combinations of symbols which seemed vaguely familiar . the briefly scrawled message was this , and its mystery lent purpose to the shaken pair , who forthwith walked steadily out to the ward car and gave orders to be driven first to a quiet dining place and then to the john hay library on the hill .\\n\\nat the library it was easy to find good manuals of palaeography , and over these the two men puzzled till the lights of evening shone out from the great chandelier . in the end they found what was needed . the letters were indeed no fantastic invention , but the normal script of a very dark period . they were the pointed saxon minuscules of the eighth or ninth century a .d . , and brought with them memories of an uncouth time when under a fresh christian veneer ancient faiths and ancient rites stirred stealthily , and the pale moon of britain looked sometimes on strange deeds in the roman ruins of caerleon and hexham , and by the towers along hadrian\\'s crumbling wall . the words were in such latin as a barbarous age might remember--\\'corvinus necandus est . cadaver aq(ua) forti dissolvendum , nec aliq(ui)d retinendum . tace ut potes .\\'--which may roughly be translated , \"curwen must be killed . the body must be dissolved in aqua fortis , nor must anything be retained . keep silence as best you are able .\"\\n\\nwillett and mr . ward were mute and baffled . they had met the unknown , and found that they lacked emotions to respond to it as they vaguely believed they ought . with willett , especially , the capacity for receiving fresh impressions of awe was well-nigh exhausted ; and both men sat still and helpless till the closing of the library forced them to leave . then they drove listlessly to the ward mansion in prospect street , and talked to no purpose into the night . the doctor rested toward morning , but did not go home . and he was still there sunday noon when a telephone message came from the detectives who had been assigned to look up dr . allen .\\n\\nmr . ward , who was pacing nervously about in a dressing-gown , answered the call in person ; and told the men to come up early the next day when he heard their report was almost ready . both willett and he were glad that this phase of the matter was taking form , for whatever the origin of the strange minuscule message , it seemed certain the \"curwen\" who must be destroyed could be no other than the bearded and spectacled stranger . charles had feared this man , and had said in the frantic note that he must be killed and dissolved in acid . allen , moreover , had been receiving letters from the strange wizards in europe under the name of curwen , and palpably regarded himself as an avatar of the bygone necromancer . and now from a fresh and unknown source had come a message saying that \"curwen\" must be killed and dissolved in acid . the linkage was too unmistakable to be factitious ; and besides , was not allen planning to murder young ward upon the advice of the creature called hutchinson ? of course , the letter they had seen had never reached the bearded stranger ; but from its text they could see that allen had already formed plans for dealing with the youth if he grew too \"squeamish\" . without doubt , allen must be apprehended ; and even if the most drastic directions were not carried out , he must be placed where he could inflict no harm upon charles ward .\\n\\nthat afternoon , hoping against hope to extract some gleam of information anent the inmost mysteries from the only available one capable of giving it , the father and the doctor went down the bay and called on young charles at the hospital . simply and gravely willett told him all he had found , and noticed how pale he turned as each description made certain the truth of the discovery . the physician employed as much dramatic effect as he could , and watched for a wincing on charles\\'s part when he approached the matter of the covered pits and the nameless hybrids within . but ward did not wince . willett paused , and his voice grew indignant as he spoke of how the things were starving . he taxed the youth with shocking inhumanity , and shivered when only a sardonic laugh came in reply . for charles , having dropped as useless his pretence that the crypt did not exist , seemed to see some ghastly jest in this affair ; and chucked hoarsely at something which amused him . then he whispered , in accents doubly terrible because of the cracked voice he used , \\'damn \\'em , they do eat , but they don\\'t need to ! that\\'s the rare part ! a month , you say , without food ? lud , sir , you be modest ! d\\'ye know , that was the joke on poor old whipple with his virtuous bluster ! kill everything off , would he ? why , damme , he was half-deaf with noise from outside and never saw or heard aught from the wells ! he never dreamed they were there at all ! devil take ye , those cursed things have been howling down there ever since curwen was done for a hundred and fifty-seven years gone !\\'\\n\\nbut no more than this could willett get from the youth . horrified , yet almost convinced against his will , he went on with his tale in the hope that some incident might startle his auditor out of the mad composure he maintained . looking at the youth\\'s face , the doctor could not but feel a kind of terror at the changes which recent months had wrought . truly , the boy had drawn down nameless horrors from the skies . when the room with the formulae and the greenish dust was mentioned , charles shewed his first sign of animation . a quizzical look overspread his face as he heard what willett had read on the pad , and he ventured the mild statement that those notes were old ones , of no possible significance to anyone not deeply initiated in the history of magic . but , he added , \\'had you but known the words to bring up that which i had out in the cup , you had not been here to tell me this . \\'twas number 118 , and i conceive you would have shook had you looked it up in my list in t\\'other room . \\'twas never raised by me , but i meant to have it up that day you came to invite me hither .\\'\\n\\nthen willett told of the formula he had spoken and of the greenish-black smoke which had arisen ; and as he did so he saw true fear dawn for the first time on charles ward\\'s face . \\'it came , and you be here alive ?\\' as ward croaked the words his voice seemed almost to burst free of its trammels and sink to cavernous abysses of uncanny resonance . willett , gifted with a flash of inspiration , believed he saw the situation , and wove into his reply a caution from a letter he remembered . \\'no . 118 , you say ? but don\\'t forget that stones are all changed now in nine grounds out of ten . you are never sure till you question !\\' and then , without warning , he drew forth the minuscule message and flashed it before the patient\\'s eyes . he could have wished no stronger result , for charles ward fainted forthwith .\\n\\nall this conversation , of course , had been conducted with the greatest secrecy lest the resident alienists accuse the father and the physician of encouraging a madman in his delusions . unaided , too , dr . willett and mr . ward picked up the stricken youth and placed him on the couch . in reviving , the patient mumbled many times of some word which he must get to orne and hutchinson at once ; so when his consciousness seemed fully back the doctor told him that of those strange creatures at least one was his bitter enemy , and had given dr . allen advice for his assassination . this revelation produced no visible effect , and before it was made the visitors could see that their host had already the look of a hunted man . after that he would converse no more , so willett and the father departed presently ; leaving behind a caution against the bearded allen , to which the youth only replied that this individual was very safely taken care of , and could do no one any harm even if he wished . this was said with an almost evil chuckle very painful to hear . they did not worry about any communications charles might indite to that monstrous pair in europe , since they knew that the hospital authorities seized all outgoing mail for censorship and would pass no wild or outr\\xc3\\xa9-looking missive .\\n\\nthere is , however , a curious sequel to the matter of orne and hutchinson , if such indeed the exiled wizards were . moved by some vague presentiment amidst the horrors of that period , willett arranged with an international press-cutting bureau for accounts of notable current crimes and accidents in prague and in eastern transylvania ; and after six months believed that he had found two very significant things amongst the multifarious items he received and had translated . one was the total wrecking of a house by night in the oldest quarter of prague , and the disappearance of the evil old man called josef nadek , who had dwelt in it alone ever since anyone could remember . the other was a titan explosion in the transylvanian mountains east of rakus , and the utter extirpation with all its inmates of the ill-regarded castle ferenczy , whose master was so badly spoken of by peasants and soldiery alike that he would shortly have been summoned to bucharest for serious questioning had not this incident cut off a career already so long as to antedate all common memory . willett maintains that the hand which wrote those minuscules was able to wield stronger weapons as well ; and that while curwen was left to him to dispose of , the writer felt able to find and deal with orne and hutchinson itself . of what their fate may have been the doctor strives sedulously not to think .\\n\\n6\\n\\nthe following morning dr . willett hastened to the ward home to be present when the detectives arrived . allen\\'s destruction or imprisonment--or curwen\\'s if one might regard the tacit claim to reincarnation as valid--he felt must be accomplished at any cost , and he communicated this conviction to mr . ward as they sat waiting for the men to come . they were downstairs this time , for the upper parts of the house were beginning to be shunned because of a particular nauseousness which hung indefinitely about ; a nauseousness which the older servants connected with some curse left by the vanished curwen portrait .\\n\\nat nine o\\'clock the three detectives presented themselves and immediately delivered all that they had to say . they had not , regrettably enough , located the brava tony gomes as they had wished , nor had they found the least trace of dr . allen\\'s source or present whereabouts ; but they had managed to unearth a considerable number of local impressions and facts concerning the reticent stranger . allen had struck pawtuxet people as a vaguely unnatural being , and there was a universal belief that his thick sandy beard was either dyed or false--a belief conclusively upheld by the finding of such a false beard , together with a pair of dark glasses , in his room at the fateful bungalow . his voice , mr . ward could well testify from his one telephone conversation , had a depth and hollowness that could not be forgotten ; and his glanced seemed malign even through his smoked and horn-rimmed glasses . one shopkeeper , in the course of negotiations , had seen a specimen of his handwriting and declared it was very queer and crabbed ; this being confirmed by pencilled notes of no clear meaning found in his room and identified by the merchant . in connexion with the vampirism rumours of the preceding summer , a majority of the gossips believed that allen rather than ward was the actual vampire . statements were also obtained from the officials who had visited the bungalow after the unpleasant incident of the motor truck robbery . they had felt less of the sinister in dr . allen , but had recognised him as the dominant figure in the queer shadowy cottage . the place had been too dark for them to observe him clearly , but they would know him again if they saw him . his beard had looked odd , and they thought he had some slight scar above his dark spectacled right eye . as for the detectives\\' search of allen\\'s room , it yielded nothing definite save the beard and glasses , and several pencilled notes in a crabbed writing which willett at once saw was identical with that shared by the old curwen manuscripts and by the voluminous recent notes of young ward found in the vanished catacombs of horror .\\n\\ndr . willett and mr . ward caught something of a profound , subtle , and insidious cosmic fear from this data as it was gradually unfolded , and almost trembled in following up the vague , mad thought which had simultaneously reached their minds . the false beard and glasses--the crabbed curwen penmanship--the old portrait and its tiny scar--and the altered youth in the hospital with such a scar--that deep , hollow voice on the telephone--was it not of this that mr . ward was reminded when his son barked forth those pitiable tones to which he now claimed to be reduced ? who had ever seen charles and allen together ? yes , the officials had once , but who later on ? was it not when allen left that charles suddenly lost his growing fright and began to live wholly at the bungalow ? curwen--allen--ward--in what blasphemous and abominable fusion had two ages and two persons become involved ? that damnable resemblance of the picture to charles--had it not used to stare and stare , and follow the boy around the room with its eyes ? why , too , did both allen and charles copy joseph curwen\\'s handwriting , even when alone and off guard ? and then the frightful work of those people--the lost crypt of horrors that had aged the doctor overnight ; the starving monsters in the noisome pits ; the awful formula which had yielded such nameless results ; the message in minuscules found in willett\\'s pocket ; the papers and the letters and all the talk of graves and \"salts\" and discoveries--whither did everything lead ? in the end mr . ward did the most sensible thing . steeling himself against any realisation of why he did it , he gave the detectives an article to be shewn to such pawtuxet shopkeepers as had seen the portentous dr . allen . that article was a photograph of his luckless son , on which he now carefully drew in ink the pair of heavy glasses and the black pointed beard which the men had brought from allen\\'s room .\\n\\nfor two hours he waited with the doctor in the oppressive house where fear and miasma were slowly gathering as the empty panel in the upstairs library leered and leered and leered . then the men returned . yes . the altered photograph was a very passable likeness of dr . allen . mr . ward turned pale , and willett wiped a suddenly dampened brow with his handkerchief . allen--ward--curwen--it was becoming too hideous for coherent thought . what had the boy called out of the void , and what had it done to him ? what , really , had happened from first to last ? who was this allen who sought to kill charles as too \"squeamish\" , and why had his destined victim said in the postscript to that frantic letter that he must be so completely obliterated in acid ? why , too , had the minuscule message , of whose origin no one dared think , said that \"curwen\" must be likewise obliterated ? what was the change , and when had the final stage occurred ? that day when his frantic note was received--he had been nervous all the morning , then there was an alteration . he had slipped out unseen and swaggered boldly in past the men hired to guard him . that was the time , when he was out . but no--had he not cried out in terror as he entered his study--this very room ? what had he found there ? or wait--what had found him ? that simulacrum which brushed boldly in without having been seen to go--was that an alien shadow and a horror forcing itself upon a trembling figure which had never gone out at all ? had not the butler spoken of queer noises ?\\n\\nwillett rang for the man and asked him some low-toned questions . it had , surely enough , been a bad business . there had been noises--a cry , a gasp , a choking , and a sort of clattering or creaking or thumping , or all of these . and mr . charles was not the same when he stalked out without a word . the butler shivered as he spoke , and sniffed at the heavy air that blew down from some open window upstairs . terror had settled definitely upon the house , and only the business-like detectives failed to imbibe a full measure of it . even they were restless , for this case had held vague elements in the background which pleased them not at all . dr . willett was thinking deeply and rapidly , and his thoughts were terrible ones . now and then he would almost break into muttering as he ran over in his head a new , appalling , and increasingly conclusive chain of nightmare happenings .\\n\\nthen mr . ward made a sign that the conference was over , and everyone save him and the doctor left the room . it was noon now , but shadows as of coming night seemed to engulf the phantom-haunted mansion . willett began talking very seriously to his host , and urged that he leave a great deal of the future investigation to him . there would be , he predicted , certain obnoxious elements which a friend could bear better than a relative . as family physician he must have a free hand , and the first thing he required was a period alone and undisturbed in the abandoned library upstairs , where the ancient overmantel had gathered about itself an aura of noisome horror more intense than when joseph curwen\\'s features themselves glanced slyly down from the painted panel .\\n\\nmr . ward , dazed by the flood of grotesque morbidities and unthinkably maddening suggestions that poured in upon him from every side , could only acquiesce ; and half an hour later the doctor was locked in the shunned room with the panelling from olney court . the father , listening outside , heard fumbling sounds of moving and rummaging as the moments passed ; and finally a wrench and a creak , as if a tight cupboard door were being opened . then there was a muffled cry , a kind of snorting choke , and a hasty slamming of whatever had been opened . almost at once the key rattled and willett appeared in the hall , haggard and ghastly , and demanding wood for the real fireplace on the south wall of the room . the furnace was not enough , he said ; and the electric log had little practical use . longing yet not daring to ask questions , mr . ward gave the requisite orders and a man brought some stout pine logs , shuddering as he entered the tainted air of the library to place them in the grate . willett meanwhile had gone up to the dismantled laboratory and brought down a few odds and ends not included in the moving of the july before . they were in a covered basket , and mr . ward never saw what they were .\\n\\nthen the doctor locked himself in the library once more , and by the clouds of smoke which rolled down past the windows from the chimney it was known that he had lighted the fire . later , after a great rustling of newspapers , that odd wrench and creaking were heard again ; followed by a thumping which none of the eavesdroppers liked . thereafter two suppressed cries of willett\\'s were heard , and hard upon these came a swishing rustle of indefinable hatefulness . finally the smoke that the wind beat down from the chimney grew very dark and acrid , and everyone wished that the weather had spared them this choking and venomous inundation of peculiar fumes . mr . ward\\'s head reeled , and the servants all clustered together in a knot to watch the horrible black smoke swoop down . after an age of waiting the vapours seemed to lighted , and half-formless sounds of scraping , sweeping , and other minor operations were heard behind the bolted door . and at last , after the slamming of some cupboard within , willett made his appearance--sad , pale , and haggard , and bearing the cloth-draped basket he had taken from the upstairs laboratory . he had left the window open , and into that once accursed room was pouring a wealth of pure , wholesome air to mix with a queer new smell of disinfectants . the ancient overmantel still lingered ; but it seemed robbed of malignity now , and rose as calm and stately in its white panelling as if it had never borne the picture of joseph curwen . night was coming on , yet this time its shadows held no latent fright , but only a gentle melancholy . of what he had done the doctor would never speak . to mr . ward he said , \\'i can answer no questions , but i will say that there are different kinds of magic . i have made a great purgation , and those in this house will sleep the better for it .\\'\\n\\n7\\n\\nthat dr . willett\\'s \"purgation\" had been an ordeal almost as nerve-racking in its way as his hideous wandering in the vanished crypt is shewn by the fact that the elderly physician gave out completely as soon as he reached home that evening . for three days he rested constantly in his room , though servants later muttered something about having heard him after midnight on wednesday , when the outer door softly opened and closed with phenomenal softness . servants\\' imaginations , fortunately , are limited , else comment might have been excited by an item in thursday\\'s evening bulletin which ran as follows :\\n\\nnorth end ghouls again active\\n\\nafter a lull of ten months since the dastardly vandalism in the weeden lot at the north burial ground , a nocturnal prowler was glimpsed early this morning in the same cemetery by robert hart , the night watchman . happening to glance for a moment from his shelter at about 2 a .m . , hart observed the glow of a lantern or pocket torch not far to the northwest , and upon opening the door detected the figure of a man with a trowel very plainly silhouetted against a nearby electric light . at once starting in pursuit , he saw the figure dart hurriedly toward the main entrance , gaining the street and losing himself among the shadows before approach or capture was possible .\\n\\nlike the first of the ghouls active during the past year , this intruder had done no real damage before detection . a vacant part of the ward lot shewed signs of a little superficial digging , but nothing even nearly the size of a grave had been attempted , and no previous grave had been disturbed .\\n\\nhart , who cannot describe the prowler except as a small man probably having a full beard , inclines to the view that all three of the digging incidents have a common source ; but police from the second station think otherwise on account of the savage nature of the second incident , where an ancient coffin was removed and its headstone violently shattered .\\n\\nthe first of the incidents , in which it is thought an attempt to bury something was frustrated , occurred a year ago last march , and has been attributed to bootleggers seeking a cache . it is possible , says sergt . riley , that this third affair is of similar nature . officers at the second station are taking especial pains to capture the gang of miscreants responsible for these repeated outrages .\\n\\nall day thursday dr . willett rested as if recuperating from something past or nerving himself for something to come . in the evening he wrote a note to mr . ward , which was delivered the next morning and which caused the half-dazed parent to ponder long and deeply . mr . ward had not been able to go down to business since the shock of monday with its baffling reports and its sinister \"purgation\" , but he found something calming about the doctor\\'s letter in spite of the despair it seemed to promise and the fresh mysteries it seemed to evoke .\\n\\n10 barnes st . , providence , r . i .\\n\\napril 12 , 1928 .\\n\\ndear theodore :-\\n\\ni feel that i must say a word to you before doing what i am going to do tomorrow . it will conclude the terrible business we have been going through (for i feel that no spade is ever likely to reach that monstrous place we know of) , but i\\'m afraid it won\\'t set your mind at rest unless i expressly assure you how very conclusive it is .\\n\\nyou have known me ever since you were a small boy , so i think you will not distrust me when i hint that some matters are best left undecided and unexplored . it is better that you attempt no further speculation as to charles\\'s case , and almost imperative that you tell his mother nothing more than she already suspects . when i call on you tomorrow charles will have escaped . that is all which need remain in anyone\\'s mind . he was mad , and he escaped . you can tell his mother gently and gradually about the mad part when you stop sending the typed notes in his name . i\\'d advise you to join her in atlantic city and take a rest yourself . god knows you need one after this shock , as i do myself . i am going south for a while to calm down and brace up .\\n\\nso don\\'t ask me any questions when i call . it may be that something will go wrong , but i\\'ll tell you if it does . i don\\'t think it will . there will be nothing more to worry about , for charles will be very , very safe . he is now--safer than you dream . you need hold no fears about allen , and who or what he is . he forms as much a part of the past as joseph curwen\\'s picture , and when i ring your doorbell you may feel certain that there is no such person . and what wrote that minuscule message will never trouble you or yours .\\n\\nbut you must steel yourself to melancholy , and prepare your wife to do the same . i must tell you frankly that charles\\'s escape will not mean his restoration to you . he has been afflicted with a peculiar disease , as you must realise from the subtle physical as well as mental changes in him , and you must not hope to see him again . have only this consolation--that he was never a fiend or even truly a madman , but only an eager , studious , and curious boy whose love of mystery and of the past was his undoing . he stumbled on things no mortal ought ever to know , and reached back through the years as no one ever should reach ; and something came out of those years to engulf him .\\n\\nand now comes the matter in which i must ask you to trust me most of all . for there will be , indeed , no uncertainty about charles\\'s fate . in about a year , say , you can if you wish devise a suitable account of the end ; for the boy will be no more . you can put up a stone in your lot at the north burial ground exactly ten feet west of your father\\'s and facing the same way , and that will mark the true resting-place of your son . nor need you fear that it will mark any abnormality or changeling . the ashes in that grave will be those of your own unaltered bone and sinew--of the real charles dexter ward whose mind you watched from infancy--the real charles with the olive-mark on his hip and without the black witch-mark on his chest or the pit on his forehead . the charles who never did actual evil , and who will have paid with his life for his \"squeamishness\" .\\n\\nthat is all . charles will have escaped , and a year from now you can put up his stone . do not question me tomorrow . and believe that the honour of your ancient family remains untainted now , as it has been at all times in the past .\\n\\nwith profoundest sympathy , and exhortations to fortitude , calmness , and resignation , i am ever\\n\\nsincerely your friend , marinus b . willett .\\n\\nso on the morning of friday , april 13 , 1928 , marinus bicknell willett visited the room of charles dexter ward at dr . waite\\'s private hospital on conanicut island . the youth , though making no attempt to evade his caller , was in a sullen mood ; and seemed disinclined to open the conversation which willett obviously desired . the doctor\\'s discovery of the crypt and his monstrous experience therein had of course created a new source of embarrassment , so that both hesitated perceptibly after the interchange of a few strained formalities . then a new element of constraint crept in , as ward seemed to read behind the doctor\\'s mask-like face a terrible purpose which had never been there before . the patient quailed , conscious that since the last visit there had been a change whereby the solicitous family physician had given place to the ruthless and implacable avenger .\\n\\nward actually turned pale , and the doctor was the first to speak . \\'more ,\\' he said , \\'has been found out , and i must warn you fairly that a reckoning is due .\\'\\n\\n\\'digging again , and coming upon more poor starving pets ?\\' was the ironic reply . it was evident that the youth meant to shew bravado to the last .\\n\\n\\'no ,\\' willett slowly rejoined , \\'this time i did not have to dig . we have had men looking up dr . allen , and they found the false beard and spectacles in the bungalow .\\'\\n\\n\\'excellent ,\\' commented the disquieted host in an effort to be wittily insulting , \\'and i trust they proved more becoming than the beard and glasses you now have on !\\'\\n\\n\\'they would become you very well ,\\' came the even and studied response , \\'as indeed they seem to have done .\\'\\n\\nas willett said this , it almost seemed as though a cloud passed over the sun ; though there was no change in the shadows on the floor . then ward ventured :\\n\\n\\'and is this what asks so hotly for a reckoning ? suppose a man does find it now and then useful to be twofold ?\\'\\n\\n\\'no\\' , said willett gravely , \\'again you are wrong . it is no business of mine if any man seeks duality ;

i know how you drew him into the past and got him to raise you up from your detestable grave ; i know how he kept you hidden in his laboratory while you studied modern things and roved abroad as a vampire by night , and how you later shewed yourself in beard and glasses that no one might wonder at your godless likeness to him ; i know what you resolved to do when he balked at your monstrous rifling of the world\\'s tombs , and at what you planned afterward  , and i know how you did it .\\n\\n\\'you left off your beard and glasses and fooled the guards around the house . they thought it was he who went in , and they thought it was he who came out when you had strangled and hidden him . but you hadn\\'t reckoned on the different contents of two minds . you were a fool , joseph curwen , to fancy that a mere visual identity would be enough . why didn\\'t you think of the speech and the voice and the handwriting ? it hasn\\'t worked , you see , after all . you know better than i who or what wrote that message in minuscules , but i will warn you it was not written in vain . there are abominations and blasphemies which must be stamped out , and i believe that the writer of those words will attend to orne and hutchinson . one of those creatures wrote you once , \"do not call up any that you can not put down\" . you were undone once before , perhaps in that very way , and it may be that your own evil magic will undo you all again . curwen , a man can\\'t tamper with nature beyond certain limits , and every horror you have woven will rise up to wipe you out .\\'\\n\\nbut here the doctor was cut short by a convulsive cry from the creature before him . hopelessly at bay , weaponless , and knowing that any show of physical violence would bring a score of attendants to the doctor\\'s rescue , joseph curwen had recourse to his one ancient ally , and began a series of cabbalistic motions with his forefingers as his deep , hollow voice , now unconcealed by feigned hoarseness , bellowed out the opening words of a terrible formula .\\n\\n\\'per adonai eloim , adonai jehova , adonai sabaoth , metraton  . . .\\'\\n\\nbut willett was too quick for him . even as the dogs in the yard outside began to howl , and even as a chill wind sprang suddenly up from the bay , the doctor commenced the solemn and measured intonation of that which he had meant all along to recite . an eye for an eye--magic for magic--let the outcome shew how well the lesson of the abyss had been learned ! so in a clear voice marinus bicknell willett began the second of that pair of formulae whose first had raised the writer of those minuscules--the cryptic invocation whose heading was the dragon\\'s tail , sign of the descending node--\\n\\nogthrod ai\\'f geb\\'l-ee\\'h yog-sothoth \\'ngah\\'ng ai\\'y zhro !\\n\\nat the very first word from willett\\'s mouth the previously commenced formula of the patient stopped short . unable to speak , the monster made wild motions with his arms until they too were arrested . when the awful name of yog-sothoth was uttered , the hideous change began . it was not merely a dissolution , but rather a transformation or recapitulation ; and willett shut his eyes lest he faint before the rest of the incantation could be pronounced .\\n\\nbut he did not faint , and that man of unholy centuries and forbidden secrets never troubled the world again . the madness out of time had subsided , and the case of charles dexter ward was closed . opening his eyes before staggering out of that room of horror , dr . willett saw that what he had kept in memory had not been kept amiss . there had , as he had predicted , been no need for acids . for like his accursed picture a year before , joseph curwen now lay scattered on the floor as a thin coating of fine bluish-grey dust .\\n', shape=(), dtype=string)\n",

the barren , the broken . and yet i am strangely content and cling desperately to those sere memories , when my mind momentarily threatens to reach beyond to the other .\\n\\ni know not where i was born , save that the castle was infinitely old and infinitely horrible , full of dark passages and having high ceilings where the eye could find only cobwebs and shadows . the stones in the crumbling corridors seemed always hideously damp , and there was an accursed smell everywhere , as of the piled-up corpses of dead generations . it was never light , so that i used sometimes to light candles and gaze steadily at them for relief , nor was there any sun outdoors , since the terrible trees grew high above the topmost accessible tower . there was one black tower which reached above the trees into the unknown outer sky , but that was partly ruined and could not be ascended save by a well-nigh impossible climb up the sheer wall , stone by stone .\\n\\ni must have lived years in this place , but i cannot measure the time . beings must have cared for my needs , yet i cannot recall any person except myself , or anything alive but the noiseless rats and bats and spiders . i think that whoever nursed me must have been shockingly aged , since my first conception of a living person was that of somebody mockingly like myself , yet distorted , shrivelled , and decaying like the castle . to me there was nothing grotesque in the bones and skeletons that strewed some of the stone crypts deep down among the foundations . i fantastically associated these things with everyday events , and thought them more natural than the coloured pictures of living beings which i found in many of the mouldy books . from such books i learned all that i know . no teacher urged or guided me , and i do not recall hearing any human voice in all those years--not even my own ; for although i had read of speech , i had never thought to try to speak aloud . my aspect was a matter equally unthought of , for there were no mirrors in the castle , and i merely regarded myself by instinct as akin to the youthful figures i saw drawn and painted in the books . i felt conscious of youth because i remembered so little .\\n\\noutside , across the putrid moat and under the dark mute trees , i would often lie and dream for hours about what i read in the books ; and would longingly picture myself amidst gay crowds in the sunny world beyond the endless forests . once i tried to escape from the forest , but as i went farther from the castle the shade grew denser and the air more filled with brooding fear ; so that i ran frantically back lest i lose my way in a labyrinth of nighted silence .\\n\\nso through endless twilights i dreamed and waited , though i knew not what i waited for . then in the shadowy solitude my longing for light grew so frantic that i could rest no more , and i lifted entreating hands to the single black ruined tower that reached above the forest into the unknown outer sky . and at last i resolved to scale that tower , fall though i might ; since it were better to glimpse the sky and perish , than to live without ever beholding day .\\n\\nin the dank twilight i climbed the worn and aged stone stairs till i reached the level where they ceased , and thereafter clung perilously to small footholds leading upward . ghastly and terrible was that dead , stairless cylinder of rock ; black , ruined , and deserted , and sinister with startled bats whose wings made no noise . but more ghastly and terrible still was the slowness of my progress ; for climb as i might , the darkness overhead grew no thinner , and a new chill as of haunted and venerable mould assailed me . i shivered as i wondered why i did not reach the light , and would have looked down had i dared . i fancied that night had come suddenly upon me , and vainly groped with one free hand for a window embrasure , that i might peer out and above , and try to judge the height i had once attained .\\n\\nall at once , after an infinity of awesome , sightless , crawling up that concave and desperate precipice , i felt my head touch a solid thing , and i knew i must have gained the roof , or at least some kind of floor . in the darkness i raised my free hand and tested the barrier , finding it stone and immovable . then came a deadly circuit of the tower , clinging to whatever holds the slimy wall could give ; till finally my testing hand found the barrier yielding , and i turned upward again , pushing the slab or door with my head as i used both hands in my fearful ascent . there was no light revealed above , and as my hands went higher i knew that my climb was for the nonce ended ; since the slab was the trapdoor of an aperture leading to a level stone surface of greater circumference than the lower tower , no doubt the floor of some lofty and capacious observation chamber . i crawled through carefully , and tried to prevent the heavy slab from falling back into place , but failed in the latter attempt . as i lay exhausted on the stone floor i heard the eerie echoes of its fall , hoped when necessary to pry it up again .\\n\\nbelieving i was now at prodigious height , far above the accursed branches of the wood , i dragged myself up from the floor and fumbled about for windows , that i might look for the first time upon the sky , and the moon and stars of which i had read . but on every hand i was disappointed ; since all that i found were vast shelves of marble , bearing odious oblong boxes of disturbing size . more and more i reflected , and wondered what hoary secrets might abide in this high apartment so many aeons cut off from the castle below . then unexpectedly my hands came upon a doorway , where hung a portal of stone , rough with strange chiselling . trying it , i found it locked ; but with a supreme burst of strength i overcame all obstacles and dragged it open inward . as i did so there came to me the purest ecstasy i have ever known ; for shining tranquilly through an ornate grating of iron , and down a short stone passageway of steps that ascended from the newly found doorway , was the radiant full moon , which i had never before seen save in dreams and in vague visions i dared not call memories .\\n\\nfancying now that i had attained the very pinnacle of the castle , i commenced to rush up the few steps beyond the door ; but the sudden veiling of the moon by a cloud caused me to stumble , and i felt my way more slowly in the dark . it was still very dark when i reached the grating--which i tried carefully and found unlocked , but which i did not open for fear of falling from the amazing height to which i had climbed . then the moon came out .\\n\\nmost demoniacal of all shocks is that of the abysmally unexpected and grotesquely unbelievable . nothing i had before undergone could compare in terror with what i now saw ; with the bizarre marvels that sight implied . the sight itself was as simple as it was stupefying , for it was merely this : instead of a dizzying prospect of treetops seen from a lofty eminence , there stretched around me on the level through the grating nothing less than the solid ground , decked and diversified by marble slabs and columns , and overshadowed by an ancient stone church , whose ruined spire gleamed spectrally in the moonlight .\\n\\nhalf unconscious , i opened the grating and staggered out upon the white gravel path that stretched away in two directions . my mind , stunned and chaotic as it was , still held the frantic craving for light ; and not even the fantastic wonder which had happened could stay my course . i neither knew nor cared whether my experience was insanity , dreaming , or magic ; but was determined to gaze on brilliance and gaiety at any cost . i knew not who i was or what i was , or what my surroundings might be ; though as i continued to stumble along i became conscious of a kind of fearsome latent memory that made my progress not wholly fortuitous . i passed under an arch out of that region of slabs and columns , and wandered through the open country ; sometimes following the visible road , but sometimes leaving it curiously to tread across meadows where only occasional ruins bespoke the ancient presence of a forgotten road . once i swam across a swift river where crumbling , mossy masonry told of a bridge long vanished .\\n\\nover two hours must have passed before i reached what seemed to be my goal , a venerable ivied castle in a thickly wooded park , maddeningly familiar , yet full of perplexing strangeness to me . i saw that the moat was filled in , and that some of the well-known towers were demolished , whilst new wings existed to confuse the beholder . but what i observed with chief interest and delight were the open windows--gorgeously ablaze with light and sending forth sound of the gayest revelry . advancing to one of these i looked in and saw an oddly dressed company indeed ; making merry , and speaking brightly to one another . i had never , seemingly , heard human speech before and could guess only vaguely what was said . some of the faces seemed to hold expressions that brought up incredibly remote recollections , others were utterly alien .\\n\\ni now stepped through the low window into the brilliantly lighted room , stepping as i did so from my single bright moment of hope to my blackest convulsion of despair and realization . the nightmare was quick to come , for as i entered , there occurred immediately one of the most terrifying demonstrations i had ever conceived . scarcely had i crossed the sill when there descended upon the whole company a sudden and unheralded fear of hideous intensity , distorting every face and evoking the most horrible screams from nearly every throat . flight was universal , and in the clamour and panic several fell in a swoon and were dragged away by their madly fleeing companions . many covered their eyes with their hands , and plunged blindly and awkwardly in their race to escape , overturning furniture and stumbling against the walls before they managed to reach one of the many doors .\\n\\nthe cries were shocking ; and as i stood in the brilliant apartment alone and dazed , listening to their vanishing echoes , i trembled at the thought of what might be lurking near me unseen . at a casual inspection the room seemed deserted , but when i moved towards one of the alcoves i thought i detected a presence there--a hint of motion beyond the golden-arched doorway leading to another and somewhat similar room . as i approached the arch i began to perceive the presence more clearly ; and then , with the first and last sound i ever uttered--a ghastly ululation that revolted me almost as poignantly as its noxious cause--i beheld in full , frightful vividness the inconceivable , indescribable , and unmentionable monstrosity which had by its simple appearance changed a merry company to a herd of delirious fugitives .\\n\\ni cannot even hint what it was like , for it was a compound of all that is unclean , uncanny , unwelcome , abnormal , and detestable . it was the ghoulish shade of decay , antiquity , and dissolution ; the putrid , dripping eidolon of unwholesome revelation , the awful baring of that which the merciful earth should always hide . god knows it was not of this world--or no longer of this world--yet to my horror i saw in its eaten-away and bone-revealing outlines a leering , abhorrent travesty on the human shape ; and in its mouldy , disintegrating apparel an unspeakable quality that chilled me even more .\\n\\ni was almost paralysed , but not too much so to make a feeble effort towards flight ; a backward stumble which failed to break the spell in which the nameless , voiceless monster held me . my eyes bewitched by the glassy orbs which stared loathsomely into them , refused to close ; though they were mercifully blurred , and showed the terrible object but indistinctly after the first shock . i tried to raise my hand to shut out the sight , yet so stunned were my nerves that my arm could not fully obey my will . the attempt , however , was enough to disturb my balance ; so that i had to stagger forward several steps to avoid falling . as i did so i became suddenly and agonizingly aware of the nearness of the carrion thing , whose hideous hollow breathing i half fancied i could hear . nearly mad , i found myself yet able to throw out a hand to ward of the foetid apparition which pressed so close ; when in one cataclysmic second of cosmic nightmarishness and hellish accident my fingers touched the rotting outstretched paw of the monster beneath the golden arch .\\n\\ni did not shriek , but all the fiendish ghouls that ride the nightwind shrieked for me as in that same second there crashed down upon my mind a single fleeting avalanche of soul-annihilating memory . i knew in that second all that had been ; i remembered beyond the frightful castle and the trees , and recognized the altered edifice in which i now stood ; i recognized , most terrible of all , the unholy abomination that stood leering before me as i withdrew my sullied fingers from its own .\\n\\nbut in the cosmos there is balm as well as bitterness , and that balm is nepenthe . in the supreme horror of that second i forgot what had horrified me , and the burst of black memory vanished in a chaos of echoing images . in a dream i fled from that haunted and accursed pile , and ran swiftly and silently in the moonlight . when i returned to the churchyard place of marble and went down the steps i found the stone trap-door immovable ; but i was not sorry , for i had hated the antique castle and the trees . now i ride with the mocking and friendly ghouls on the night-wind , and play by day amongst the catacombs of nephren-ka in the sealed and unknown valley of hadoth by the nile . i know that light is not for me , save that of the moon over the rock tombs of neb , nor any gaiety save the unnamed feasts of nitokris beneath the great pyramid ; yet in my new wildness and freedom i almost welcome the bitterness of alienage .\\n\\nfor although nepenthe has calmed me , i know always that i am an outsider ; a stranger in this century and among those who are still men . this i have known ever since i stretched out my fingers to the abomination within that great gilded frame ; stretched out my fingers and touched a cold and unyielding surface of polished glass .\\n', shape=(), dtype=string)\n",

fool or god that he was--my only friend , who led me and went before me , and who in the end passed into terrors which may yet be mine !\\n\\nwe met , i recall , in a railway station , where he was the center of a crowd of the vulgarly curious . he was unconscious , having fallen in a kind of convulsion which imparted to his slight black-clad body a strange rigidity . i think he was then approaching forty years of age , for there were deep lines in the face , wan and hollow-cheeked , but oval and actually beautiful ; and touches of gray in the thick , waving hair and small full beard which had once been of the deepest raven black . his brow was white as the marble of pentelicus , and of a height and breadth almost god-like .\\n\\ni said to myself , with all the ardor of a sculptor , that this man was a faun's statue out of antique hellas , dug from a temple's ruins and brought somehow to life in our stifling age only to feel the chill and pressure of devastating years . and when he opened his immense , sunken , and wildly luminous black eyes i knew he would be thenceforth my only friend--the only friend of one who had never possessed a friend before--for i saw that such eyes must have looked fully upon the grandeur and the terror of realms beyond normal consciousness and reality ; realms which i had cherished in fancy , but vainly sought . so as i drove the crowd away i told him he must come home with me and be my teacher and leader in unfathomed mysteries , and he assented without speaking a word . afterward i found that his voice was music--the music of deep viols and of crystalline spheres . we talked often in the night , and in the day , when i chiseled busts of him and carved miniature heads in ivory to immortalize his different expressions .\\n\\nof our studies it is impossible to speak , since they held so slight a connection with anything of the world as living men conceive it . they were of that vaster and more appalling universe of dim entity and consciousness which lies deeper than matter , time , and space , and whose existence we suspect only in certain forms of sleep-those rare dreams beyond dreams which come never to common men , and but once or twice in the lifetime of imaginative men . the cosmos of our waking knowledge , born from such an universe as a bubble is born from the pipe of a jester , touches it only as such a bubble may touch its sardonic source when sucked back by the jester's whim . men of learning suspect it little and ignore it mostly . wise men have interpreted dreams , and the gods have laughed . one man with oriental eyes has said that all time and space are relative , and men have laughed . but even that man with oriental eyes has done no more than suspect . i had wished and tried to do more than suspect , and my friend had tried and partly succeeded . then we both tried together , and with exotic drugs courted terrible and forbidden dreams in the tower studio chamber of the old manor-house in hoary kent .\\n\\namong the agonies of these after days is that chief of torments- inarticulateness . what i learned and saw in those hours of impious exploration can never be told--for want of symbols or suggestions in any language . i say this because from first to last our discoveries partook only of the nature of sensations ; sensations correlated with no impression which the nervous system of normal humanity is capable of receiving . they were sensations , yet within them lay unbelievable elements of time and space--things which at bottom possess no distinct and definite existence . human utterance can best convey the general character of our experiences by calling them plungings or soarings ; for in every period of revelation some part of our minds broke boldly away from all that is real and present , rushing aerially along shocking , unlighted , and fear-haunted abysses , and occasionally tearing through certain well-marked and typical obstacles describable only as viscous , uncouth clouds of vapors .\\n\\nin these black and bodiless flights we were sometimes alone and sometimes together . when we were together , my friend was always far ahead ; i could comprehend his presence despite the absence of form by a species of pictorial memory whereby his face appeared to me , golden from a strange light and frightful with its weird beauty , its anomalously youthful cheeks , its burning eyes , its olympian brow , and its shadowing hair and growth of beard .\\n\\nof the progress of time we kept no record , for time had become to us the merest illusion . i know only that there must have been something very singular involved , since we came at length to marvel why we did not grow old . our discourse was unholy , and always hideously ambitious--no god or demon could have aspired to discoveries and conquest like those which we planned in whispers . i shiver as i speak of them , and dare not be explicit ; though i will say that my friend once wrote on paper a wish which he dared not utter with his tongue , and which made me burn the paper and look affrightedly out of the window at the spangled night sky . i will hint--only hint--that he had designs which involved the rulership of the visible universe and more ; designs whereby the earth and the stars would move at his command , and the destinies of all living things be his . i affirm--i swear--that i had no share in these extreme aspirations . anything my friend may have said or written to the contrary must be erroneous , for i am no man of strength to risk the unmentionable spheres by which alone one might achieve success .\\n\\nthere was a night when winds from unknown spaces whirled us irresistibly into limitless vacuum beyond all thought and entity . perceptions of the most maddeningly untransmissible sort thronged upon us ; perceptions of infinity which at the time convulsed us with joy , yet which are now partly lost to my memory and partly incapable of presentation to others . viscous obstacles were clawed through in rapid succession , and at length i felt that we had been borne to realms of greater remoteness than any we had previously known .\\n\\nmy friend was vastly in advance as we plunged into this awesome ocean of virgin aether , and i could see the sinister exultation on his floating , luminous , too-youthful memory-face . suddenly that face became dim and quickly disappeared , and in a brief space i found myself projected against an obstacle which i could not penetrate . it was like the others , yet incalculably denser ; a sticky clammy mass , if such terms can be applied to analogous qualities in a non-material sphere .\\n\\ni had , i felt , been halted by a barrier which my friend and leader had successfully passed . struggling anew , i came to the end of the drug--dream and opened my physical eyes to the tower studio in whose opposite corner reclined the pallid and still unconscious form of my fellow dreamer , weirdly haggard and wildly beautiful as the moon shed gold-green light on his marble features .\\n\\nthen , after a short interval , the form in the corner stirred ; and may pitying heaven keep from my sight and sound another thing like that which took place before me . i cannot tell you how he shrieked , or what vistas of unvisitable hells gleamed for a second in black eyes crazed with fright . i can only say that i fainted , and did not stir till he himself recovered and shook me in his frensy for someone to keep away the horror and desolation .\\n\\nthat was the end of our voluntary searchings in the caverns of dream . awed , shaken , and portentous , my friend who had been beyond the barrier warned me that we must never venture within those realms again . what he had seen , he dared not tell me ; but he said from his wisdom that we must sleep as little as possible , even if drugs were necessary to keep us awake . that he was right , i soon learned from the unutterable fear which engulfed me whenever consciousness lapsed .\\n\\nafter each short and inevitable sleep i seemed older , whilst my friend aged with a rapidity almost shocking . it is hideous to see wrinkles form and hair whiten almost before one's eyes . our mode of life was now totally altered . heretofore a recluse so far as i know-his true name and origin never having passed his lips--my friend now became frantic in his fear of solitude . at night he would not be alone , nor would the company of a few persons calm him . his sole relief was obtained in revelry of the most general and boisterous sort ; so that few assemblies of the young and gay were unknown to us .\\n\\nour appearance and age seemed to excite in most cases a ridicule which i keenly resented , but which my friend considered a lesser evil than solitude . especially was he afraid to be out of doors alone when the stars were shining , and if forced to this condition he would often glance furtively at the sky as if hunted by some monstrous thing therein . he did not always glance at the same place in the sky-it seemed to be a different place at different times . on spring evenings it would be low in the northeast . in the summer it would be nearly overhead . in the autumn it would be in the northwest . in winter it would be in the east , but mostly if in the small hours of morning .\\n\\nmidwinter evenings seemed least dreadful to him . only after two years did i connect this fear with anything in particular ; but then i began to see that he must be looking at a special spot on the celestial vault whose position at different times corresponded to the direction of his glance--a spot roughly marked by the constellation corona borealis .\\n\\nwe now had a studio in london , never separating , but never discussing the days when we had sought to plumb the mysteries of the unreal world . we were aged and weak from our drugs , dissipations , and nervous overstrain , and the thinning hair and beard of my friend had become snow-white . our freedom from long sleep was surprising , for seldom did we succumb more than an hour or two at a time to the shadow which had now grown so frightful a menace .\\n\\nthen came one january of fog and rain , when money ran low and drugs were hard to buy . my statues and ivory heads were all sold , and i had no means to purchase new materials , or energy to fashion them even had i possessed them . we suffered terribly , and on a certain night my friend sank into a deep-breathing sleep from which i could not awaken him . i can recall the scene now--the desolate , pitch-black garret studio under the eaves with the rain beating down ; the ticking of our lone clock ; the fancied ticking of our watches as they rested on the dressing-table ; the creaking of some swaying shutter in a remote part of the house ; certain distant city noises muffled by fog and space ; and , worst of all , the deep , steady , sinister breathing of my friend on the couch--a rhythmical breathing which seemed to measure moments of supernal fear and agony for his spirit as it wandered in spheres forbidden , unimagined , and hideously remote .\\n\\nthe tension of my vigil became oppressive , and a wild train of trivial impressions and associations thronged through my almost unhinged mind . i heard a clock strike somewhere--not ours , for that was not a striking clock--and my morbid fancy found in this a new starting-point for idle wanderings . clocks--time--space--infinity-and then my fancy reverted to the locale as i reflected that even now , beyond the roof and the fog and the rain and the atmosphere , corona borealis was rising in the northeast . corona borealis , which my friend had appeared to dread , and whose scintillant semicircle of stars must even now be glowing unseen through the measureless abysses of aether . all at once my feverishly sensitive ears seemed to detect a new and wholly distinct component in the soft medley of drug-magnified sounds--a low and damnably insistent whine from very far away ; droning , clamoring , mocking , calling , from the northeast .\\n\\nbut it was not that distant whine which robbed me of my faculties and set upon my soul such a seal of fright as may never in life be removed ; not that which drew the shrieks and excited the convulsions which caused lodgers and police to break down the door . it was not what i heard , but what i saw ; for in that dark , locked , shuttered , and curtained room there appeared from the black northeast corner a shaft of horrible red-gold light--a shaft which bore with it no glow to disperse the darkness , but which streamed only upon the recumbent head of the troubled sleeper , bringing out in hideous duplication the luminous and strangely youthful memory-face as i had known it in dreams of abysmal space and unshackled time , when my friend had pushed behind the barrier to those secret , innermost and forbidden caverns of nightmare .\\n\\nand as i looked , i beheld the head rise , the black , liquid , and deep--sunken eyes open in terror , and the thin , shadowed lips part as if for a scream too frightful to be uttered . there dwelt in that ghastly and flexible face , as it shone bodiless , luminous , and rejuvenated in the blackness , more of stark , teeming , brain-shattering fear than all the rest of heaven and earth has ever revealed to me .\\n\\nno word was spoken amidst the distant sound that grew nearer and nearer , but as i followed the memory-face's mad stare along that cursed shaft of light to its source , the source whence also the whining came , i , too , saw for an instant what it saw , and fell with ringing ears in that fit of shrieking epilepsy which brought the lodgers and the police . never could i tell , try as i might , what it actually was that i saw ; nor could the still face tell , for although it must have seen more than i did , it will never speak again . but always i shall guard against the mocking and insatiate hypnos , lord of sleep , against the night sky , and against the mad ambitions of knowledge and philosophy .\\n\\njust what happened is unknown , for not only was my own mind unseated by the strange and hideous thing , but others were tainted with a forgetfulness which can mean nothing if not madness . they have said , i know not for what reason , that i never had a friend ; but that art , philosophy , and insanity had filled all my tragic life . the lodgers and police on that night soothed me , and the doctor administered something to quiet me , nor did anyone see what a nightmare event had taken place . my stricken friend moved them to no pity , but what they found on the couch in the studio made them give me a praise which sickened me , and now a fame which i spurn in despair as i sit for hours , bald , gray-bearded , shriveled , palsied , drug-crazed , and broken , adoring and praying to the object they found .\\n\\nfor they deny that i sold the last of my statuary , and point with ecstasy at the thing which the shining shaft of light left cold , petrified , and unvocal . it is all that remains of my friend ; the friend who led me on to madness and wreckage ; a godlike head of such marble as only old hellas could yield , young with the youth that is outside time , and with beauteous bearded face , curved , smiling lips , olympian brow , and dense locks waving and poppy-crowned . they say that that haunting memory-face is modeled from my own , as it was at twenty--five ;

but all the peasants and police in county meath could never find him , or the others , though they searched long and far . and now i shudder when i hear the frogs piping in swamps , or see the moon in lonely places .\\n\\ni had known denys barry well in america , where he had grown rich , and had congratulated him when he bought back the old castle by the bog at sleepy kilderry . it was from kilderry that his father had come , and it was there that he wished to enjoy his wealth among ancestral scenes . men of his blood had once ruled over kilderry and built and dwelt in the castle , but those days were very remote , so that for generations the castle had been empty and decaying . after he went to ireland , barry wrote me often , and told me how under his care the gray castle was rising tower by tower to its ancient splendor , how the ivy was climbing slowly over the restored walls as it had climbed so many centuries ago , and how the peasants blessed him for bringing back the old days with his gold from over the sea . but in time there came troubles , and the peasants ceased to bless him , and fled away instead as from a doom . and then he sent a letter and asked me to visit him , for he was lonely in the castle with no one to speak to save the new servants and laborers he had brought from the north .\\n\\nthe bog was the cause of all these troubles , as barry told me the night i came to the castle . i had reached kilderry in the summer sunset , as the gold of the sky lighted the green of the hills and groves and the blue of the bog , where on a far islet a strange olden ruin glistened spectrally . that sunset was very beautiful , but the peasants at ballylough had warned me against it and said that kilderry had become accursed , so that i almost shuddered to see the high turrets of the castle gilded with fire . barry's motor had met me at the ballylough station , for kilderry is off the railway . the villagers had shunned the car and the driver from the north , but had whispered to me with pale faces when they saw i was going to kilderry . and that night , after our reunion , barry told me why .\\n\\nthe peasants had gone from kilderry because denys barry was to drain the great bog . for all his love of ireland , america had not left him untouched , and he hated the beautiful wasted space where peat might be cut and land opened up . the legends and superstitions of kilderry did not move him , and he laughed when the peasants first refused to help , and then cursed him and went away to ballylough with their few belongings as they saw his determination . in their place he sent for laborers from the north , and when the servants left he replaced them likewise . but it was lonely among strangers , so barry had asked me to come .\\n\\nwhen i heard the fears which had driven the people from kilderry , i laughed as loudly as my friend had laughed , for these fears were of the vaguest , wildest , and most absurd character . they had to do with some preposterous legend of the bog , and a grim guardian spirit that dwelt in the strange olden ruin on the far islet i had seen in the sunset . there were tales of dancing lights in the dark of the moon , and of chill winds when the night was warm ; of wraiths in white hovering over the waters , and of an imagined city of stone deep down below the swampy surface . but foremost among the weird fancies , and alone in its absolute unanimity , was that of the curse awaiting him who should dare to touch or drain the vast reddish morass . there were secrets , said the peasants , which must not be uncovered ; secrets that had lain hidden since the plague came to the children of partholan in the fabulous years beyond history . in the book of invaders it is told that these sons of the greeks were all buried at tallaght , but old men in kilderry said that one city was overlooked save by its patron moon--goddess ; so that only the wooded hills buried it when the men of nemed swept down from scythia in their thirty ships .\\n\\nsuch were the idle tales which had made the villagers leave kilderry , and when i heard them i did not wonder that denys barry had refused to listen . he had , however , a great interest in antiquities , and proposed to explore the bog thoroughly when it was drained . the white ruins on the islet he had often visited , but though their age was plainly great , and their contour very little like that of most ruins in ireland , they were too dilapidated to tell the days of their glory . now the work of drainage was ready to begin , and the laborers from the north were soon to strip the forbidden bog of its green moss and red heather , and kill the tiny shell-paved streamlets and quiet blue pools fringed with rushes .\\n\\nafter barry had told me these things i was very drowsy , for the travels of the day had been wearying and my host had talked late into the night . a man-servant showed me to my room , which was in a remote tower overlooking the village and the plain at the edge of the bog , and the bog itself ; so that i could see from my windows in the moonlight the silent roofs from which the peasants had fled and which now sheltered the laborers from the north , and too , the parish church with its antique spire , and far out across the brooding bog the remote olden ruin on the islet gleaming white and spectral . just as i dropped to sleep i fancied i heard faint sounds from the distance ; sounds that were wild and half musical , and stirred me with a weird excitement which colored my dreams . but when i awaked next morning i felt it had all been a dream , for the visions i had seen were more wonderful than any sound of wild pipes in the night . influenced by the legends that barry had related , my mind had in slumber hovered around a stately city in a green valley , where marble streets and statues , villas and temples , carvings and inscriptions , all spoke in certain tones the glory that was greece . when i told this dream to barry we had both laughed ; but i laughed the louder , because he was perplexed about his laborers from the north . for the sixth time they had all overslept , waking very slowly and dazedly , and acting as if they had not rested , although they were known to have gone early to bed the night before .\\n\\nthat morning and afternoon i wandered alone through the sun-gilded village and talked now and then with idle laborers , for barry was busy with the final plans for beginning his work of drainage . the laborers were not as happy as they might have been , for most of them seemed uneasy over some dream which they had had , yet which they tried in vain to remember . i told them of my dream , but they were not interested till i spoke of the weird sounds i thought i had heard . then they looked oddly at me , and said that they seemed to remember weird sounds , too .\\n\\nin the evening barry dined with me and announced that he would begin the drainage in two days . i was glad , for although i disliked to see the moss and the heather and the little streams and lakes depart , i had a growing wish to discern the ancient secrets the deep-matted peat might hide . and that night my dreams of piping flutes and marble peristyles came to a sudden and disquieting end ; for upon the city in the valley i saw a pestilence descend , and then a frightful avalanche of wooded slopes that covered the dead bodies in the streets and left unburied only the temple of artemis on the high peak , where the aged moon-priestess cleis lay cold and silent with a crown of ivory on her silver head .\\n\\ni have said that i awaked suddenly and in alarm . for some time i could not tell whether i was waking or sleeping , for the sound of flutes still rang shrilly in my ears ; but when i saw on the floor the icy moonbeams and the outlines of a latticed gothic window , i decided i must be awake and in the castle of kilderry . then i heard a clock from some remote landing below strike the hour of two , and knew i was awake . yet still there came that monstrous piping from afar ; wild , weird airs that made me think of some dance of fauns on distant maenalus . it would not let me sleep , and in impatience i sprang up and paced the floor . only by chance did i go to the north window and look out upon the silent village and the plain at the edge of the bog . i had no wish to gaze abroad , for i wanted to sleep ; but the flutes tormented me , and i had to do or see something . how could i have suspected the thing i was to behold ?\\n\\nthere in the moonlight that flooded the spacious plain was a spectacle which no mortal , having seen it , could ever forget . to the sound of reedy pipes that echoed over the bog there glided silently and eerily a mixed throng of swaying figures , reeling through such a revel as the sicilians may have danced to demeter in the old days under the harvest moon beside the cyane . the wide plain , the golden moonlight , the shadowy moving forms , and above all the shrill monotonous piping , produced an effect which almost paralyzed me ; yet i noted amidst my fear that half of these tireless mechanical dancers were the laborers whom i had thought asleep , whilst the other half were strange airy beings in white , half-indeterminate in nature , but suggesting pale wistful naiads from the haunted fountains of the bog . i do not know how long i gazed at this sight from the lonely turret window before i dropped suddenly in a dreamless swoon , out of which the high sun of morning aroused me .\\n\\nmy first impulse on awaking was to communicate all my fears and observations to denys barry , but as i saw the sunlight glowing through the latticed east window i became sure that there was no reality in what i thought i had seen . i am given to strange fantasms , yet am never weak enough to believe in them ; so on this occasion contented myself with questioning the laborers , who slept very late and recalled nothing of the previous night save misty dreams of shrill sounds . this matter of the spectral piping harassed me greatly , and i wondered if the crickets of autumn had come before their time to vex the night and haunt the visions of men . later in the day i watched barry in the library poring over his plans for the great work which was to begin on the morrow , and for the first time felt a touch of the same kind of fear that had driven the peasants away . for some unknown reason i dreaded the thought of disturbing the ancient bog and its sunless secrets , and pictured terrible sights lying black under the unmeasured depth of age-old peat . that these secrets should be brought to light seemed injudicious , and i began to wish for an excuse to leave the castle and the village . i went so far as to talk casually to barry on the subject , but did not dare continue after he gave his resounding laugh . so i was silent when the sun set fulgently over the far hills , and kilderry blazed all red and gold in a flame that seemed a portent .\\n\\nwhether the events of that night were of reality or illusion i shall never ascertain . certainly they transcend anything we dream of in nature and the universe ; yet in no normal fashion can i explain those disappearances which were known to all men after it was over . i retired early and full of dread , and for a long time could not sleep in the uncanny silence of the tower . it was very dark , for although the sky was clear the moon was now well in the wane , and would not rise till the small hours . i thought as i lay there of denys barry , and of what would befall that bog when the day came , and found myself almost frantic with an impulse to rush out into the night , take barry's car , and drive madly to ballylough out of the menaced lands . but before my fears could crystallize into action i had fallen asleep , and gazed in dreams upon the city in the valley , cold and dead under a shroud of hideous shadow .\\n\\nprobably it was the shrill piping that awaked me , yet that piping was not what i noticed first when i opened my eyes . i was lying with my back to the east window overlooking the bog , where the waning moon would rise , and therefore expected to see light cast on the opposite wall before me ; but i had not looked for such a sight as now appeared . light indeed glowed on the panels ahead , but it was not any light that the moon gives . terrible and piercing was the shaft of ruddy refulgence that streamed through the gothic window , and the whole chamber was brilliant with a splendor intense and unearthly . my immediate actions were peculiar for such a situation , but it is only in tales that a man does the dramatic and foreseen thing . instead of looking out across the bog toward the source of the new light , i kept my eyes from the window in panic fear , and clumsily drew on my clothing with some dazed idea of escape . i remember seizing my revolver and hat , but before it was over i had lost them both without firing the one or donning the other . after a time the fascination of the red radiance overcame my fright , and i crept to the east window and looked out whilst the maddening , incessant piping whined and reverberated through the castle and over all the village .\\n\\nover the bog was a deluge of flaring light , scarlet and sinister , and pouring from the strange olden ruin on the far islet . the aspect of that ruin i can not describe--i must have been mad , for it seemed to rise majestic and undecayed , splendid and column-cinctured , the flame--reflecting marble of its entablature piercing the sky like the apex of a temple on a mountain-top . flutes shrieked and drums began to beat , and as i watched in awe and terror i thought i saw dark saltant forms silhouetted grotesquely against the vision of marble and effulgence . the effect was titanic--altogether unthinkable--and i might have stared indefinitely had not the sound of the piping seemed to grow stronger at my left . trembling with a terror oddly mixed with ecstasy , i crossed the circular room to the north window from which i could see the village and the plain at the edge of the bog . there my eyes dilated again with a wild wonder as great as if i had not just turned from a scene beyond the pale of nature , for on the ghastly red-litten plain was moving a procession of beings in such a manner as none ever saw before save in nightmares .\\n\\nhalf gliding , half floating in the air , the white-clad bog-wraiths were slowly retreating toward the still waters and the island ruin in fantastic formations suggesting some ancient and solemn ceremonial dance . their waving translucent arms , guided by the detestable piping of those unseen flutes , beckoned in uncanny rhythm to a throng of lurching laborers who followed doglike with blind , brainless , floundering steps as if dragged by a clumsy but resistless demon-will . as the naiads neared the bog , without altering their course , a new line of stumbling stragglers zigzagged drunkenly out of the castle from some door far below my window , groped sightlessly across the courtyard and through the intervening bit of village , and joined the floundering column of laborers on the plain . despite their distance below me i at once knew they were the servants brought from the north , for i recognized the ugly and unwieldy form of the cook , whose very absurdness had now become unutterably tragic . the flutes piped horribly , and again i heard the beating of the drums from the direction of the island ruin . then silently and gracefully the naiads reached the water and melted one by one into the ancient bog ; while the line of followers , never checking their speed , splashed awkwardly after them and vanished amidst a tiny vortex of unwholesome bubbles which i could barely see in the scarlet light . and as the last pathetic straggler , the fat cook , sank heavily out of sight in that sullen pool , the flutes and the drums grew silent , and the blinding red rays from the ruins snapped instantaneously out , leaving the village of doom lone and desolate in the wan beams of a new-risen moon .\\n\\nmy condition was now one of indescribable chaos . not knowing whether i was mad or sane , sleeping or waking , i was saved only by a merciful numbness . i believe i did ridiculous things such as offering prayers to artemis , latona , demeter , persephone , and plouton . all that i recalled of a classic youth came to my lips as the horrors of the situation roused my deepest superstitions . i felt that i had witnessed the death of a whole village , and knew i was alone in the castle with denys barry , whose boldness had brought down a doom . as i thought of him , new terrors convulsed me , and i fell to the floor ; not fainting , but physically helpless . then i felt the icy blast from the east window where the moon had risen , and began to hear the shrieks in the castle far below me . soon those shrieks had attained a magnitude and quality which can not be written of , and which makes me faint as i think of them . all i can say is that they came from something i had known as a friend .\\n\\nat some time during this shocking period the cold wind and the screaming must have roused me , for my next impression is of racing madly through inky rooms and corridors and out across the courtyard into the hideous night . they found me at dawn wandering mindless near ballylough , but what unhinged me utterly was not any of the horrors i had seen or heard before . what i muttered about as i came slowly out of the shadows was a pair of fantastic incidents which occurred in my flight : incidents of no significance , yet which haunt me unceasingly when i am alone in certain marshy places or in the moonlight .\\n\\nas i fled from that accursed castle along the bog's edge i heard a new sound : common , yet unlike any i had heard before at kilderry . the stagnant waters , lately quite devoid of animal life , now teemed with a horde of slimy enormous frogs which piped shrilly and incessantly in tones strangely out of keeping with their size . they glistened bloated and green in the moonbeams , and seemed to gaze up at the fount of light . i followed the gaze of one very fat and ugly frog , and saw the second of the things which drove my senses away .\\n\\nstretching directly from the strange olden ruin on the far islet to the waning moon , my eyes seemed to trace a beam of faint quivering radiance having no reflection in the waters of the bog . and upward along that pallid path my fevered fancy pictured a thin shadow slowly writhing ; a vague contorted shadow struggling as if drawn by unseen demons . crazed as i was , i saw in that awful shadow a monstrous resemblance--a nauseous , unbelievable caricature--a blasphemous effigy of him who had been denys barry .\\n\", shape=(), dtype=string)\n",
            "tf.Tensor(b\"celephais\\n\\nin a dream kuranes saw the city in the valley , and the seacoast beyond , and the snowy peak overlooking the sea , and the gaily painted galleys that sail out of the harbour toward distant regions where the sea meets the sky . in a dream it was also that he came by his name of kuranes , for when awake he was called by another name .\\n\\nperhaps it was natural for him to dream a new name ; for he was the last of his family , and alone among the indifferent millions of london , so there were not many to speak to him and to remind him who he had been . his money and lands were gone , and he did not care for the ways of the people about him , but preferred to dream and write of his dreams . what he wrote was laughed at by those to whom he showed it , so that after a time he kept his writings to himself , and finally ceased to write .\\n\\nthe more he withdrew from the world about him , the more wonderful became his dreams ; and it would have been quite futile to try to describe them on paper . kuranes was not modern , and did not think like others who wrote . whilst they strove to strip from life its embroidered robes of myth and to show in naked ugliness the foul thing that is reality , kuranes sought for beauty alone . when truth and experience failed to reveal it , he sought it in fancy and illusion , and found it on his very doorstep , amid the nebulous memories of childhood tales and dreams .\\n\\nthere are not many persons who know what wonders are opened to them in the stories and visions of their youth ; for when as children we listen and dream , we think but half-formed thoughts , and when as men we try to remember , we are dulled and prosaic with the poison of life . but some of us awake in the night with strange phantasms of enchanted hills and gardens , of fountains that sing in the sun , of golden cliffs overhanging murmuring seas , of plains that stretch down to sleeping cities of bronze and stone , and of shadowy companies of heroes that ride caparisoned white horses along the edges of thick forests ; and then we know that we have looked back through the ivory gates into that world of wonder which was ours before we were wise and unhappy .\\n\\nkuranes came very suddenly upon his old world of childhood . he had been dreaming of the house where he had been born ; the great stone house covered with ivy , where thirteen generations of his ancestors had lived , and where he had hoped to die . it was moonlight , and he had stolen out into the fragrant summer night , through the gardens , down the terraces , past the great oaks of the park , and along the long white road to the village . the village seemed very old , eaten away at the edge like the moon which had commenced to wane , and kuranes wondered whether the peaked roofs of the small houses hid sleep or death . in the streets were spears of long grass , and the window-panes on either side broken or filmily staring . kuranes had not lingered , but had plodded on as though summoned toward some goal . he dared not disobey the summons for fear it might prove an illusion like the urges and aspirations of waking life , which do not lead to any goal . then he had been drawn down a lane that led off from the village street toward the channel cliffs , and had come to the end of things to the precipice and the abyss where all the village and all the world fell abruptly into the unechoing emptiness of infinity , and where even the sky ahead was empty and unlit by the crumbling moon and the peering stars . faith had urged him on , over the precipice and into the gulf , where he had floated down , down , down ; past dark , shapeless , undreamed dreams , faintly glowing spheres that may have been partly dreamed dreams , and laughing winged things that seemed to mock the dreamers of all the worlds . then a rift seemed to open in the darkness before him , and he saw the city of the valley , glistening radiantly far , far below , with a background of sea and sky , and a snowcapped mountain near the shore .\\n\\nkuranes had awakened the very moment he beheld the city , yet he knew from his brief glance that it was none other than celephais , in the valley of ooth-nargai beyond the tanarian hills where his spirit had dwelt all the eternity of an hour one summer afternoon very long ago , when he had slipt away from his nurse and let the warm sea-breeze lull him to sleep as he watched the clouds from the cliff near the village . he had protested then , when they had found him , waked him , and carried him home , for just as he was aroused he had been about to sail in a golden galley for those alluring regions where the sea meets the sky . and now he was equally resentful of awaking , for he had found his fabulous city after forty weary years .\\n\\nbut three nights afterward kuranes came again to celephais . as before , he dreamed first of the village that was asleep or dead , and of the abyss down which one must float silently ; then the rift appeared again , and he beheld the glittering minarets of the city , and saw the graceful galleys riding at anchor in the blue harbour , and watched the gingko trees of mount aran swaying in the sea-breeze . but this time he was not snatched away , and like a winged being settled gradually over a grassy hillside til finally his feet rested gently on the turf . he had indeed come back to the valley of ooth-nargai and the splendid city of celephais .\\n\\ndown the hill amid scented grasses and brilliant flowers walked kuranes , over the bubbling naraxa on the small wooden bridge where he had carved his name so many years ago , and through the whispering grove to the great stone bridge by the city gate . all was as of old , nor were the marble walls discoloured , nor the polished bronze statues upon them tarnished . and kuranes saw that he need not tremble lest the things he knew be vanished ; for even the sentries on the ramparts were the same , and still as young as he remembered them . when he entered the city , past the bronze gates and over the onyx pavements , the merchants and camel-drivers greeted him as if he had never been away ; and it was the same at the turquoise temple of nath-horthath , where the orchid-wreathed priests told him that there is no time in ooth--nargai , but only perpetual youth . then kuranes walked through the street of pillars to the seaward wall , where gathered the traders and sailors , and strange men from the regions where the sea meets the sky . there he stayed long , gazing out over the bright harbour where the ripples sparkled beneath an unknown sun , and where rode lightly the galleys from far places over the water . and he gazed also upon mount aran rising regally from the shore , its lower slopes green with swaying trees and its white summit touching the sky .\\n\\nmore than ever kuranes wished to sail in a galley to the far places of which he had heard so many strange tales , and he sought again the captain who had agreed to carry him so long ago . he found the man , athib , sitting on the same chest of spice he had sat upon before , and athib seemed not to realize that any time had passed . then the two rowed to a galley in the harbour , and giving orders to the oarmen , commenced to sail out into the billowy cerenarian sea that leads to the sky . for several days they glided undulatingly over the water , till finally they came to the horizon , where the sea meets the sky . here the galley paused not at all , but floated easily in the blue of the sky among fleecy clouds tinted with rose . and far beneath the keel kuranes could see strange lands and rivers and cities of surpassing beauty , spread indolently in the sunshine which seemed never to lessen or disappear . at length athib told him that their journey was near its end , and that they would soon enter the harbour of serannian , the pink marble city of the clouds , which is built on that ethereal coast where the west wind flows into the sky ; but as the highest of the city's carven towers came into sight there was a sound somewhere in space , and kuranes awaked in his london garret .\\n\\nfor many months after that kuranes sought the marvellous city of celephais and its sky-bound galleys in vain ; and though his dreams carried him to many gorgeous and unheard-of places , no one whom he met could tell him how to find ooth-nargai beyond the tanarian hills . one night he went flying over dark mountains where there were faint , lone campfires at great distances apart , and strange , shaggy herds with tinkling bells on the leaders , and in the wildest part of this hilly country , so remote that few men could ever have seen it , he found a hideously ancient wall or causeway of stone zigzagging along the ridges and valleys ; too gigantic ever to have risen by human hands , and of such a length that neither end of it could be seen . beyond that wall in the grey dawn he came to a land of quaint gardens and cherry trees , and when the sun rose he beheld such beauty of red and white flowers , green foliage and lawns , white paths , diamond brooks , blue lakelets , carven bridges , and red-roofed pagodas , that he for a moment forgot celephais in sheer delight . but he remembered it again when he walked down a white path toward a red-roofed pagoda , and would have questioned the people of this land about it , had he not found that there were no people there , but only birds and bees and butterflies . on another night kuranes walked up a damp stone spiral stairway endlessly , and came to a tower window overlooking a mighty plain and river lit by the full moon ; and in the silent city that spread away from the river bank he thought he beheld some feature or arrangement which he had known before . he would have descended and asked the way to ooth-nargai had not a fearsome aurora sputtered up from some remote place beyond the horizon , showing the ruin and antiquity of the city , and the stagnation of the reedy river , and the death lying upon that land , as it had lain since king kynaratholis came home from his conquests to find the vengeance of the gods .\\n\\nso kuranes sought fruitlessly for the marvellous city of celephais and its galleys that sail to serannian in the sky , meanwhile seeing many wonders and once barely escaping from the high-priest not to be described , which wears a yellow silken mask over its face and dwells all alone in a prehistoric stone monastery in the cold desert plateau of leng . in time he grew so impatient of the bleak intervals of day that he began buying drugs in order to increase his periods of sleep . hasheesh helped a great deal , and once sent him to a part of space where form does not exist , but where glowing gases study the secrets of existence . and a violet-coloured gas told him that this part of space was outside what he had called infinity . the gas had not heard of planets and organisms before , but identified kuranes merely as one from the infinity where matter , energy , and gravitation exist . kuranes was now very anxious to return to minaret-studded celephais , and increased his doses of drugs ; but eventually he had no more money left , and could buy no drugs . then one summer day he was turned out of his garret , and wandered aimlessly through the streets , drifting over a bridge to a place where the houses grew thinner and thinner . and it was there that fulfillment came , and he met the cortege of knights come from celephais to bear him thither forever .\\n\\nhandsome knights they were , astride roan horses and clad in shining armour with tabards of cloth-of-gold curiously emblazoned . so numerous were they , that kuranes almost mistook them for an army , but they were sent in his honour ; since it was he who had created ooth-nargai in his dreams , on which account he was now to be appointed its chief god for evermore . then they gave kuranes a horse and placed him at the head of the cavalcade , and all rode majestically through the downs of surrey and onward toward the region where kuranes and his ancestors were born . it was very strange , but as the riders went on they seemed to gallop back through time ; for whenever they passed through a village in the twilight they saw only such houses and villagers as chaucer or men before him might have seen , and sometimes they saw knights on horseback with small companies of retainers . when it grew dark they travelled more swiftly , till soon they were flying uncannily as if in the air . in the dim dawn they came upon the village which kuranes had seen alive in his childhood , and asleep or dead in his dreams . it was alive now , and early villagers curtsied as the horsemen clattered down the street and turned off into the lane that ends in the abyss of dreams . kuranes had previously entered that abyss only at night , and wondered what it would look like by day ; so he watched anxiously as the column approached its brink . just as they galloped up the rising ground to the precipice a golden glare came somewhere out of the west and hid all the landscape in effulgent draperies . the abyss was a seething chaos of roseate and cerulean splendour , and invisible voices sang exultantly as the knightly entourage plunged over the edge and floated gracefully down past glittering clouds and silvery coruscations . endlessly down the horsemen floated , their chargers pawing the aether as if galloping over golden sands ; and then the luminous vapours spread apart to reveal a greater brightness , the brightness of the city celephais , and the sea coast beyond , and the snowy peak overlooking the sea , and the gaily painted galleys that sail out of the harbour toward distant regions where the sea meets the sky .\\n\\nand kuranes reigned thereafter over ooth-nargai and all the neighboring regions of dream , and held his court alternately in celephais and in the cloud-fashioned serannian . he reigns there still , and will reign happily for ever , though below the cliffs at innsmouth the channel tides played mockingly with the body of a tramp who had stumbled through the half-deserted village at dawn ; played mockingly , and cast it upon the rocks by ivy-covered trevor towers , where a notably fat and especially offensive millionaire brewer enjoys the purchased atmosphere of extinct nobility .\\n\", shape=(), dtype=string)\n",
            "tf.Tensor(b\"the cats of ulthar\\n\\nit is said that in ulthar , which lies beyond the river skai , no man may kill a cat ; and this i can verily believe as i gaze upon him who sitteth purring before the fire . for the cat is cryptic , and close to strange things which men cannot see . he is the soul of antique aegyptus , and bearer of tales from forgotten cities in meroe and ophir . he is the kin of the jungle's lords , and heir to the secrets of hoary and sinister africa . the sphinx is his cousin , and he speaks her language ; but he is more ancient than the sphinx , and remembers that which she hath forgotten .\\n\\nin ulthar , before ever the burgesses forbade the killing of cats , there dwelt an old cotter and his wife who delighted to trap and slay the cats of their neighbors . why they did this i know not ; save that many hate the voice of the cat in the night , and take it ill that cats should run stealthily about yards and gardens at twilight . but whatever the reason , this old man and woman took pleasure in trapping and slaying every cat which came near to their hovel ; and from some of the sounds heard after dark , many villagers fancied that the manner of slaying was exceedingly peculiar . but the villagers did not discuss such things with the old man and his wife ; because of the habitual expression on the withered faces of the two , and because their cottage was so small and so darkly hidden under spreading oaks at the back of a neglected yard . in truth , much as the owners of cats hated these odd folk , they feared them more ; and instead of berating them as brutal assassins , merely took care that no cherished pet or mouser should stray toward the remote hovel under the dark trees . when through some unavoidable oversight a cat was missed , and sounds heard after dark , the loser would lament impotently ; or console himself by thanking fate that it was not one of his children who had thus vanished . for the people of ulthar were simple , and knew not whence it is all cats first came .\\n\\none day a caravan of strange wanderers from the south entered the narrow cobbled streets of ulthar . dark wanderers they were , and unlike the other roving folk who passed through the village twice every year . in the market-place they told fortunes for silver , and bought gay beads from the merchants . what was the land of these wanderers none could tell ; but it was seen that they were given to strange prayers , and that they had painted on the sides of their wagons strange figures with human bodies and the heads of cats , hawks , rams and lions . and the leader of the caravan wore a headdress with two horns and a curious disk betwixt the horns .\\n\\nthere was in this singular caravan a little boy with no father or mother , but only a tiny black kitten to cherish . the plague had not been kind to him , yet had left him this small furry thing to mitigate his sorrow ; and when one is very young , one can find great relief in the lively antics of a black kitten . so the boy whom the dark people called menes smiled more often than he wept as he sat playing with his graceful kitten on the steps of an oddly painted wagon .\\n\\non the third morning of the wanderers' stay in ulthar , menes could not find his kitten ; and as he sobbed aloud in the market-place certain villagers told him of the old man and his wife , and of sounds heard in the night . and when he heard these things his sobbing gave place to meditation , and finally to prayer . he stretched out his arms toward the sun and prayed in a tongue no villager could understand ; though indeed the villagers did not try very hard to understand , since their attention was mostly taken up by the sky and the odd shapes the clouds were assuming . it was very peculiar , but as the little boy uttered his petition there seemed to form overhead the shadowy , nebulous figures of exotic things ; of hybrid creatures crowned with horn-flanked disks . nature is full of such illusions to impress the imaginative .\\n\\nthat night the wanderers left ulthar , and were never seen again . and the householders were troubled when they noticed that in all the village there was not a cat to be found . from each hearth the familiar cat had vanished ; cats large and small , black , grey , striped , yellow and white . old kranon , the burgomaster , swore that the dark folk had taken the cats away in revenge for the killing of menes' kitten ; and cursed the caravan and the little boy . but nith , the lean notary , declared that the old cotter and his wife were more likely persons to suspect ; for their hatred of cats was notorious and increasingly bold . still , no one durst complain to the sinister couple ; even when little atal , the innkeeper's son , vowed that he had at twilight seen all the cats of ulthar in that accursed yard under the trees , pacing very slowly and solemnly in a circle around the cottage , two abreast , as if in performance of some unheard-of rite of beasts . the villagers did not know how much to believe from so small a boy ; and though they feared that the evil pair had charmed the cats to their death , they preferred not to chide the old cotter till they met him outside his dark and repellent yard .\\n\\nso ulthar went to sleep in vain anger ; and when the people awakened at dawn--behold ! every cat was back at his accustomed hearth ! large and small , black , grey , striped , yellow and white , none was missing . very sleek and fat did the cats appear , and sonorous with purring content . the citizens talked with one another of the affair , and marveled not a little . old kranon again insisted that it was the dark folk who had taken them , since cats did not return alive from the cottage of the ancient man and his wife . but all agreed on one thing : that the refusal of all the cats to eat their portions of meat or drink their saucers of milk was exceedingly curious . and for two whole days the sleek , lazy cats of ulthar would touch no food , but only doze by the fire or in the sun .\\n\\nit was fully a week before the villagers noticed that no lights were appearing at dusk in the windows of the cottage under the trees . then the lean nith remarked that no one had seen the old man or his wife since the night the cats were away . in another week the burgomaster decided to overcome his fears and call at the strangely silent dwelling as a matter of duty , though in so doing he was careful to take with him shang the blacksmith and thul the cutter of stone as witnesses . and when they had broken down the frail door they found only this : two cleanly picked human skeletons on the earthen floor , and a number of singular beetles crawling in the shadowy corners .\\n\\nthere was subsequently much talk among the burgesses of ulthar . zath , the coroner , disputed at length with nith , the lean notary ; and kranon and shang and thul were overwhelmed with questions . even little atal , the innkeeper's son , was closely questioned and given a sweetmeat as reward . they talked of the old cotter and his wife , of the caravan of dark wanderers , of small menes and his black kitten , of the prayer of menes and of the sky during that prayer , of the doings of the cats on the night the caravan left , and of what was later found in the cottage under the dark trees in the repellent yard .\\n\\nand in the end the burgesses passed that remarkable law which is told of by traders in hatheg and discussed by travelers in nir ; namely , that in ulthar no man may kill a cat .\\n\", shape=(), dtype=string)\n"
